I imagine it'd be relevant again here. I didn't distinguish between which places offer by the slice although in certain places I have noted it and it'll include some places that are further out from downtown:\n\n* Cheeseboard and/or Sliver - Examples of sourdough crust, \"California\" style pizza. Daily rotating pizzas but they only offer cheese + vegetarian options (no meat toppings ever) but I wouldn't let that turn you off to it if you usually get meat toppings. Try it with the green sauce. Walking distance from campus and probably the most \"unique\" pizza to the area. Sells by slice or whole. Cheeseboard is the OG and probably a little better but Sliver is closer. Like I said previously I think the move here is to see what pizza is offered the day you'll be going (I think they update their schedules at the start of each week) and make the choice based on that. If you're elsewhere in the Bay you might end up near an Arizmendi bakery which is part of the same collective as Cheeseboard and also offers the same style of pizza (again with different daily toppings).\n\n* Arinell's - By-the-slice NY Style pizza right next to campus. Cheaper side of things.\n\n* Jupiter's - Beer garden near campus with pizza. I never thought their pizza stood out but they have a good ambiance and it's a great place to hang out and get beers also. Might get quite crowded depending on when you go.\n\n*    Pizzeria de Laura - Newer place near campus. Opened by a 3x pizza champion. They offer NY, Sicilian, Detroit, and Grandma style pizza. Whole pie restaurant (I think). I've been myself and they are great. The Sicilian and Detroit were both fantastic and I'd like to try all their styles. Haven't had by the slice from them though.\n\n*    Rose Pizzeria - Walking distance, more of a sit-down place that's higher priced. Whole pizzas only. NY/Neapolitan style.\n\n*    Emilia's Pizzeria - Long walk/driving/rideshare distance. This is a unique entry in that it's a one man operation. You have to order online ahead of time for pickup only and it's whole pies only. I'll admit this may not be the most feasible thing to get while visiting (as opposed to for locals who might order and bring home), but it's good NY style pizza. (https://emiliaspizzeria.com/)\n\n*    Tap in Lounge and/or Curry Pizza House - I'm not sure if Indian Pizza (pizza with Indian flavors and toppings like Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, etc.) is just a Bay Area trend or a food trend that's spreading everywhere, but here are two closest examples of places near Berkeley that offer it. If it's indeed just a Bay Area trend maybe worth checking out for uniqueness. If you like fusion and Indian you should like it. The first place I was aware of to do this is Namaste Pizza, but they're more driving/rideshare distance from campus and only do whole pies. I think the other places I mentioned would offer slices.\n\n*    Gioia's - Driving/Rideshare distance from campus, but IMO some of the best NY style pizza in the Bay. Offered by slice or whole.\n\n*    Zachary's - Driving/Rideshare distance from Berkeley but this is an example of our local take on Chicago deep dish.\n\n*    Rotten City Pizza - Driving/Rideshare distance since it's actually in nearby Emeryville, but this is also another favorite local NY-style place with pizza by the slice or whole. Not sure I'd make the trip out here just to get this pizza but maybe it'll be nearby depending on where you stay or other places you go.  \n  \n\n**NOT PERSONALLY RECOMMENDED BUT WELL KNOWN OR NEARBY:**\n\n*    Blondie's Pizza - It's popular with students but I honestly don't think their pizza is that great. I think it has location, price, and history going for it but I don't actually think the pizza stands out.  \n\n*    Artichoke Basille - Near campus, but this is an extension of a NY store. So I don't think of it as really a local spot. Pizza's not bad and the artichoke one actually kinda reminds me of chowder on a pizza. But I prefer the other NY style places I mentioned. But I do think it's better than Blondie's.  \n\n*    Seniore's Pizza - Cheap pizza near campus but nothing special. If you're opting for cheap and super close to campus either Blondie's or Artichoke would be better.  \n\n*    Gypsy's Trattoria - This is near campus in Asian Ghetto (another nickname) and a student dining stalwart. Used to get their calzones all the time when I went there especially the pesto chicken calzone. Don't know if it really holds up but as a student it was a lot of food at a pretty good price. Big enough to serve in those pink takeaway cake boxes.  \n\n*    West Coast Pizza - It's near campus and basically it's main reputation is that it's cheap and I think it ran deals and people kinda like the cheesesticks but I wouldn't go here.  \n\n*    North Beach Pizza, Bobby G's, Red Tomato - I'm aware that these three places are also in Berkeley and nearish to campus but I can't recommend if only because I actually haven't gone there myself nor heard any kind of associated buzz about them. So even if they've been around for a while now I haven't been motivated to check them out vs. places I do already know about or a newer place like Pizzeria de Laura.", "upvotes": 14}, {"body": "*Cheese Board is the original.\n*Arizmendi serves pizza authorized by CB\n**Sliver, unauthorized!", "upvotes": 0}]}, {"title": "can math 56 satisfy applied math degree?", "upvotes": 1, "created_utc": 1698454425.0, "id": "17i295p", "body": "", "comments": [{"body": "You need the differential equations", "upvotes": 1}, {"body": "Yes", "upvotes": 1}, {"body": "Yes, but a lot of upper divs require 54 and 55 for mathematical maturity but if you got it the prerequisite are not enforced", "upvotes": 1}]}, {"title": "Late change in schedule petition", "upvotes": 1, "created_utc": 1698450992.0, "id": "17i14yd", "body": "How likely would my petition to drop a class be approved.

Try art classes, go to co-op parties, strike up small talk with folks waiting in a line, join a poetry club, pretty much try out events that involves people even if that event isn't usually your thing (turns out I actually really really like art and poetry after trying my hand at both of them!). Speaking as someone that pretty much didn't have actual friends before college and thus my social skills sucked ass, it really boils down to how much effort you want to invest in getting good at socializing (beyond small talk, that typically involves taking more social risks, patience, and being vulnerable. I failed a bunch of times initially and weirded out some folks, it's a skill tho and you eventually get better at it if you're consistent). Just keep trying new stuff and be patient, take more risks that can make you look stupid and eventually people will start to flock towards you.\n\nUnrelated to social stuff, I wish I didn't pigeonhole myself so much to what I thought I was/should do. I did eecs and tried to stay engaged in the tech world afterwards but it turns out it's more of an interest than a career I'm happy with \ud83d\ude02 now I'm pursuing electrician stuff while doing odd jobs to get more clarity. I may not be making bank but I feel more alive and free, and honestly that's really what I care the most about nowadays. Maybe the electrician stuff won't work out either, I can try nursing next, regardless I'm getting a clearer idea of what I want by realizing what I don't want, something I wouldn't have achieved if I didn't take risks/stayed in my comfort zone. If you're trying to do the \"right things\" to make friends then you're still trying to stay in your comfort zone by following a plan; introduce some more spontaneity so that you're not sure if it's the right thing, find people that aren't sure either and suddenly you have a good reason for a camaraderie to flourish in this mess we call life \ud83e\udd23 you can also keep doing the \"right things\" and maybe you'll eventually have success...but personally my two closest friends were made unintentionally (one was by getting blackout drunk and vomiting twice in our room since we were roommates, that led to a chain of events where we eventually became friends. The other happened during an event for transfers, I was super into this one girl and she wasn't into me so I knocked on this one dude's dorm door that I barely knew with snot and tears running down my face because I felt he was someone I could talk to. Even then we didn't click until 2ish years later where we shared some mutual friends and started hanging out more often). Just keep trying, shake things up a bit, try new strategies if old ones don't work, dare to look stupid, etc", "upvotes": 10}]}, {"title": "Cornerstone is having free comedy tonight.", "upvotes": 7, "created_utc": 1698333281.0, "id": "17gyrxd", "body": "Starts at 8:30, it\u2019s free.", "comments": []}, {"title": "Shit my pants in class, you think my crush noticed?", "upvotes": 0, "created_utc": 1698327286.0, "id": "17gwo34", "body": "Hey.

Del Valle\u2019s colleague thought he\u2019d be a good fit for an event they were planning on the student and worker uprisings of 1968 in Mexico and elsewhere around the world.After the presentation, del Valle, a tenured associate professor of colonial studies in Berkeley\u2019s department of Spanish and Portuguese, approached him and suggested they get together to talk about the conference. Clover agreed, and two weeks later, they met at the Prizefighter Bar at the northwest tip of Oakland. She had beer; he had wine.\n\nClover would later tell investigators he felt \u201cuncomfortable with the interaction\u201d with del Valle and ended the conversation early. She began talking as though the meeting were a date, he said, and became \u201cvisibly flustered\u201d when he mentioned his partner. Del Valle remembered it differently. She considered it a social meeting with a colleague, she said, and she\u2019d suggested wrapping it up because Clover had said he had a reading group to join afterward.From there, things went rapidly downhill.Del Valle, who had been following Clover for a few months on Twitter before they met, thought afterward that he was obliquely insulting a few of her colleagues on the platform without naming them. He was becoming irritated with what he described as \u201cconfusing\u201d messages she was sending him privately about how someone was bothering her.\n\nThe dispute, which has jolted the lives and careers of two scholars highly respected in their fields, began where so many of higher-education\u2019s fiercest fights have been waged, on the platform formerly known as Twitter. There, del Valle became convinced that tweets from Clover\u2019s account, and another one she felt was associated with the professor, were delivering a series of coded \u2014 and deeply personal \u2014 taunts. By the time the dispute spiraled off the computer screen, del Valle was delivering messages instead in silver spray paint and mashed pineapple.The events that followed raise difficult questions. Among them: At a time when much of academic culture is lived on social media, where identities can be masked and threats veiled, how does a university respond to a professor\u2019s seemingly far-fetched allegations about what happens there?The Chronicle has pieced together the following account based on extensive interviews with del Valle, hundreds of pages of documents, including letters, correspondences, and screenshots she shared, along with reports Clover provided from three Title IX investigations. Del Valle\u2019s supporters have also offered testimonies from 48 current and former students, many of whom spoke with The Chronicle, about the professor\u2019s contributions as a mentor and scholar. Efforts to reach Clover\u2019s supporters were less successful, since he hasn\u2019t been speaking publicly about the dispute. The Chronicle reached out to several of his colleagues in the English department at Davis, as well as to a few supporters who weighed in on social media. The only one who responded referred the email to the university\u2019s public-relations office.\n\nWhen del Valle first approached The Chronicle in late August to urge a reporter to look into her case, she declined to identify the person she accused of hacking her phone and laptop and electronically stalking her. She identified him only as a professor at another University of California campus. The Chronicle later identified him as Joshua Clover.A tenured professor with appointments in English and comparative literature, Clover is well known in literary circles as a poet, columnist, and political theorist who directs the university\u2019s Marxist Institute for Research.

The only one who responded referred the email to the university\u2019s public-relations office.\n\nWhen del Valle first approached The Chronicle in late August to urge a reporter to look into her case, she declined to identify the person she accused of hacking her phone and laptop and electronically stalking her. She identified him only as a professor at another University of California campus. The Chronicle later identified him as Joshua Clover.\n\nA tenured professor with appointments in English and comparative literature, Clover is well known in literary circles as a poet, columnist, and political theorist who directs the university\u2019s Marxist Institute for Research. Del Valle is also well known in her field, as an expert in colonial Latin American studies and as a mentor to students who, like herself, are immigrants and the first in their families to attend college.\n\nUC-Berkeley\u2019s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination conducted three separate Title IX investigations on the case \u2014 in 2019, 2021, and 2022. All found that she had either harassed Clover or violated orders not to contact him. Del Valle is on paid administrative leave, banned from teaching, advising, and entering nonpublic parts of the campus. Clover told The Chronicle that Berkeley\u2019s interim Title IX officer has said Clover is not prohibited from sharing the reports from those investigations. He confirmed that he was the complainant but declined to comment further for this article.\n\nIn an email to a handful of del Valle\u2019s supporters, he wrote that the charges included \u201cmultiple instances of stalking, sexual harassment, retaliation, and violation of no-contact directives directed against me, my family, and my students; many many charges across many many years.\u201d\n\nDel Valle said that, to the contrary, she\u2019s the victim of sexual harassment by Clover. None of the investigations found evidence that Clover had stalked or harassed del Valle. She contends that\u2019s because the university never gave her complaints the attention they did Clover\u2019s, or fulfilled her request to perform a forensic evaluation of her phone and laptop to see if they\u2019d been hacked.\n\nThat her university is punishing her as a harasser is \u201can ironic reversal of the reasons for which Title IX regulations were created,\u201d she wrote in notes she prepared to explain her side of what would become a tangled, yearslong dispute. \u201cNot a single thing I have done or supposedly done is romantic or sexual in nature. The opposite is true. They have all been defense against humiliating abuse and sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nJanet Gilmore, a campus spokeswoman, said privacy policies prevent her from discussing the specific complaints. As a campus, she added, Berkeley is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that individuals are treated fairly.\u201d\n\nBut both Clover and del Valle have accused UC-Berkeley of mishandling the investigations by not responding promptly and consequentially to their complaints.\n\nIn the weeks and months after Clover told del Valle to stop contacting him, she said, she became unsettled by what she felt were similarities between what she was communicating on her cellphone and laptop and tweets she attributed to Clover. She would message a friend, she said, and within hours, a post would pop up on Clover\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 or another she was convinced he had access to \u2014 that seemed to be indirectly referencing it. She wrote about planning to see a friend named Isis and he posted about a restaurant with the same name, she said. She was searching on the web for a good place for French lessons, and he tweeted \u201cMoving on to daily vous, daily ils elles\u201d. She had a cellphone conversation with her son about Kendrick Lamar\u2019s song \u201cHumble\u201d and over the next two days, the word \u201chumble\u201d appeared on the two Twitter feeds where she accused Clover of stalking her.\n\nWhere many would see coincidences, del Valle saw a pattern of harassment.\n\n...", "upvotes": 26}, {"body": "https://dailycal.org/2023/08/29/protestors-gather-in-california-hall-demand-reinstatement-of-uc-berkeley-professor/", "upvotes": 15}, {"body": "WTF", "upvotes": 10}, {"body": "I swear some shit just goes down every other week, and I\u2019m just out of the loop because I\u2019m too lazy to get to class.", "upvotes": 6}]}, {"title": "transfer struggling to make friends", "upvotes": 40, "created_utc": 1698296406.0, "id": "17gouww", "body": "hi, as the title says im (20f) having a really difficult time making friends at berkeley. i'm in two very social and awesome clubs, and even in a transfer community floor of my dorm, but i cant click with anyone. i'm bubbly and kind but have been told many times im scary or unapproachable when people first meet me but it's been far past that point, as in the people i want to be friends with know my personality now. \n\ni can't shake the feeling that i've missed the boat on making friends. everyone has their groups, the people they like, and they stick to it. i was very shy and reclusive my first month here and i feel like that completely screwed me over, because now even the transfers i've met have their friend groups now. i don't really get invited to anything even though i express that i want to go to things; i'm not annoying or pushy about it but i make it known i would like to be included and it just doesn't happen. \n\ni'm taking it really personally and it's been affecting my mental health a LOT. i've never been a person that has no friends or that no one wants to be around so its been complete emotional whiplash feeling that way at berkeley. i'm really trying to put myself out there but nothing has been working out.\n\nit would be comforting to know if others are experiencing this, because i've been feeling so alone", "comments": [{"body": "I feel the exact same.

It was built in the 1860s, and remodeled in an English Tudor style by architect Julia Morgan in 1911.\n\nThe man who commissioned the remodel, William Smyth, was a somewhat eccentric English engineer who made a fortune as an inventor and patent consultant (he often was an expert witness in trials). He lived and worked in San Francisco then retired to Berkeley, where he had his dream home. Several acres of gardens extending up the hill, and the house in the middle of it.\n\nSmyth wrote a lot, including essays and a book proposing that committees of well trained engineers should basically govern the world (he created the term \"Technocracy\"). So he would fit right in with today's EECS / tech culture at Berkeley. :-)\n\nBefore he died in the 1930s, he willed the property to the University. UC wasn't quite sure what to do with it, but as World War II came to an end and there was a sudden housing crisis for women students (with all the male students coming back from military service) the University hastily built several two story dormitories there for women, plus a dining commons. The house also stayed.\n\nIn the 1970s the dormitories were converted to family student apartments. In the 1990s (?) they were torn down, leaving most of the property vacant. UC still owns it.\n\nIt has periodically been discussed as a site for student or perhaps faculty housing. One of the complications is that the Hayward Fault runs through the lower part of the property (the meadow area below the house and above Hillside Avenue) so it's no longer allowed to build there. But there is still a lot of land up the canyon behind the house. \n\nHere's a good article that gives much of the history and has early pictures of the house. \n\nhttp://berkeleyheritage.com/eastbay\\_then-now/smyth.html", "upvotes": 15}]}, {"title": "How is there an endless number of hot boys at Berkeley", "upvotes": 93, "created_utc": 1698259944.0, "id": "17gc2xh", "body": "Genuinely, there are a myriad of hot boys on campus.

Assume (more accurately, inductively suppose) your recursive call(s) will produce the correct answer, and design the answer accordingly.\n\nFor example, you could even define a recursive function to add two to a given positive number, x. add\\_two(x). By the leap of faith, add\\_two(x-1) returns you (x-1) + 2, which is x+1. So to get from that, to the desired x+2, you just +1. So, add\\_two(x) = add\\_two(x-1) + 1. Base case is the smallest value in your input domain, in this case, return 3 for x == 1.\n\nFor tree recursion (i.e if you have more than one recursive case), the big thing to think about is how to break your problem into different cases. \n\nFor example, say you have this problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/), which asks you to count the number of ways to climb a staircase of n stairs with steps of size 1 or 2. The two cases to consider are whether you take a step of size 1 of step of size 2. If you take a step of size 1, then you have a staircase of n-1 steps left, which you can solve via leap of faith. Same with the other case. So in total, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n\nHope this helps, and happy to elaborate.

Applied Math and Data Science are both admitted directly to the major. Applied Math has 51%, and Data Science has a 13% acceptance rate. With my planned classes, I will only miss Data C8 and CS 61A for the Data Science major.

CDSS Data Science: \"We accept linear algebra without differential equations from California community colleges in all cases where the course is included in a Math 54 articulation agreement.\" In this case, the single Linear Algebra course at my CC will satisfy this requirement since it is in the two part articulation agreement of Math 54.

Tailgating is allowed at all campus parking lots BUT like I said those parking lots are super limited - the tailgate I attend, the guy who runs it donates in the low five figures to the athletic department so he gets parking. I either BART to the game or find street parking and walk over to the tailgate. As an urban campus and not a traditional big football school, we do a lot of pre gaming at bars or just walking up to the stadium.\n\n3. Gotta be 21. No drinking on the streets. There is alcohol for sale at the stadium but only on the west side of the stadium.\n\n4. PLENTY. Tons of campus adjacent eateries - Top Dog is a famous hot dog stand.

If you're on campus you will never be more than a ~15 minute walk from the stadium. Or walk through it after considering it is a day game. Also restaurants on Telegraph and Durant will be packed before/after the game (moreso considering its USC), so if you want to avoid crowds then consider eating somewhere on Shattuck or University, which also happens to be closer to BART. But sounds like you want something resembling a gameday experience in which case Telegraph/Durant is definitely the move.\n\nIf you had any connections to any frats at all, then their pregames would be the closest thing you can get to a \"gameday.\" But you probably don't, in which case just walk up the hill and admire as you go.", "upvotes": 3}, {"body": ">How does parking work?\n\nyou can pay out the ass for a private lot. drive around and you'll see \"parking for $XX\" in someone's garage. otherwise park west of telegraph ave and hike to the stadium. or take public transit \n\n>Where is tailgating allowed?\n\nberk being an urban campus..........there really isn't anywhere. unless you go to a private one \n\n>What are the rules around the sale of alcoholic beverages?\n\nusual american stuff? being over 21. \n\n>Are there venues to get food before the game?\n\nall the food spots along bancroft are the popular spots. top dog is an institution. la burrita. azn ghetto. \n\n>Any other suggestions to make the experience fluid would be appreciated.\n\n* bring layers. it'll be somewhat warm during the game. but as soon as the sun sets, the breeze will roll in and things will get chilly quickly \n\n* don't wear red! unless you want to get heckled the entire game \n\n* apparently this is strictly a berk thing - just go into the section on your ticket and then mosh in. don't bother looking for your exact row/seat", "upvotes": 3}, {"body": "Welcome to Berkeley!\n\nSome ad ons to the good comments from others.\n\nTaking BART is a good idea so you avoid parking problems. As others have noted, we're an urban campus so no huge surface parking lots or open fields for tailgating, and the campus parking that does exist is generally reserved for donors / season ticket holders. Also, the City of Berkeley sees football game traffic as a cash cow, and doubles parking fines and tickets on game day.\n\nThe BART stop you'll want to exit at is **Downtown Berkeley** (There are three Berkeley stations. It's the middle one). The campus is one block east, after you exit the station. Follow the crowds east / uphill. Keep going uphill and you'll reach the Stadium right at the base of the hills. Nice walk, especially on a Fall mid-day / afternoon.\n\nTake out food before the game. Cheese 'n Stuff, sandwich place underneath one of the city garages is good, and inexpensive, for take-out sandwiches. It's one block south of the campus, so you'll make a slight detour, but an easy walk to the Stadium after that.\n\n[https://www.yelp.com/biz/cheese-n-stuff-berkeley](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cheese-n-stuff-berkeley)\n\nWeather for the afternoon game should be mild and sunny, it looks like. After dark around here the temperature drops with colder air coming in off the ocean, so as others have noted, bring layers--hoodie, sweatshirt--to wear on the way back to BART and the ride back to your car. (But our night time temperatures are utterly mild compared to cold weather Canada.)\n\nCheck the BART schedule in advance. Trains on weekends don't run really often, so you should time your arrival at the station to avoid a long wait on the platform. (Compared to most big urban transit systems, BART is a relatively small operation).\n\nAs others have said, don't wear red--Stanford and USC color, and both schools are despised here. Our colors are blue and gold. Mustard yellow is also a USC color somewhat paralleling gold for Cal, so if you're wearing some sort of yellow, plus neutral, you will pass. Other neutrals are greens, browns, grays, and any sort of darker blue will fit you in just fine with a Berkeley crowd.\n\nBe prepared for the USC Band playing their same two, monotonous, spirit songs 50 times or more during the game. It just comes with the territory.\n\nAfter the game--and even during the fourth quarter or second half, if Cal is seriously losing--there will be a steady stream of people heading back to the BART station, and probably crowded trains leaving town. So if you want to avoid the crowding at BART, stopping somewhere to have dinner a good option. Both Southside (neighborhood immediately south of campus) and Downtown Berkeley (right around the BART station) have a lot of restaurants of several price ranges.\n\nTo add to the list of food places, **Jupiter**, on the same block as the BART station, is a downtown pub with a lot of outside seating.

I don't have the exact numbers to verify. But this is my opinion. Asian immigrants post 1968 were brought in solely to sow discord and fight civil rights. \n\n1968 the National Origins Act was repealed which had limited all immigration except Northern European immigration to I believe 1890 levels which shut immigration off largely to Asians. After this was passed we didn't just let everyone in. To gain entry you have to fill out tons of forms, have the money to travel from your nation. Most Asian Immigrants were likely educated and semi successful in their country of origin yet had a reason to leave. Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian immigrants were not necessarily chosen but humanitarian fix for the fuck ups of the Vietnam War. This is likely why you see a success divide between 'Successful' ethnicities of Asian descent vs not. Why is this important? The Model Minority serves as a symbol to tell others minorities not to fight for civil rights and do as the (Sarcastic) Model Minority does. That's why the Model Minority Myth is the work of White Supremacy.  Asians who fall for it are no better than other races who dislike Asians for that status perceived or real.

One thing that just irritates me is when a white liberal lectures me on colonization/slavery - btw your ancestors were colonizers and btw my ancestors were colonized (not by your ancestors but other Asian colonizers). \n\nConservative or liberal- many people are racist and often times liberals don't realize they are just as racist as conservatives. I do want to fight for social justice and sustainable development but there are too many \"liberals\" these days destroying this movement because they think their IQ is 1000 on racial capitalism\n\nI think white \"liberals\" are just racist to smart, successful people. They love struggling, depressed Asians- and I know because I was one. They disregard the fact that the East Asian Tigers developed because we worked hard- diligently, we saved/invested, we sacrificed for the next generation without much welfare spending. Some people think it was some sort of miracle/luck but a lot of Asian cultures value education, grades, competition, accomplishment, economic success, profit, income, property, wealth, money. Yes it's toxic at times but go to Korea/Japan/China/Singapore/HK, we have better public transportation, better institutions, prohibit drugs/guns \n\nwhite liberals today are salty white conservatives want to do business with smart, successful Asians.

I earned my high school diploma in 2017 as an international student with many AP courses under my belt, even received the state honored student award and scored a 1580 on the SAT. I went on to a four-year college on the East Coast to major in physics, but things went south due to a family crisis. My parents were in an accident, I lost my mother, and I thought I would soon be forced to go back home. But my father managed to support me financially all by himself, he told me during my first year summer vacation that I had to finish my degree. He made it clear that it was important for my family's sacrifices not to go in vain.\r And if you are wondering, International students generally weren't allowed to work and had to pay almost double the tuition compared to US citizens. It would be illegal for me to earn a dime in the U.S. (Tho I did do sth that I can't talk about, just to best utilize my free time and take off some pressure from my father). I never knew if I ever recover from this family crisis. But I am sure that I was lost, living like a zombie for two years, missing classes and exams. I ended up on academic probation by the end of my first year. In the end, I got dismissed after my second year.\r  \n\r  \n I did manage to bounce back a bit, but my stubbornness and ego, fueled by my high school achievements and all the praise I got, made me think I could handle the coursework all on my own. I 'proudly' refused any help from the school, and it resulted in me finishing my Differential Equations course with a C, along with a bunch of other Cs and Ds. Most of this was because I was dealing with depression and immense pressure, but I couldn't bring myself to talk to anyone about what I was going through. To make things worse, my father's expectations felt like an invisible weight hanging over my head. \r  \n\r  \nFast forward, I've now spent four years at CCC. The first two semesters weren't perfect either, with more Cs in physics and chemistry, I struggled to adapt to this new environment, not knowing anything and living all by myself. Then COVID came, and it finally hit me that I needed help and support for my coursework, just like anyone else, I am not the special kid they used to say. Believe it or not, I hadn't gone to any office hours at this point, not even once.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to salvage my GPA during COVID, but online courses didn't work out for me. I decided to go back home to East Asia because my father needed care during the pandemic lockdown. This meant dealing with a significant time difference, having to wake up at 2 am for Zoom, cooking meals during the day, and getting my HW done while trying to take a nap every minute I got. Looking back, it was like hell and pure pressure. I had insomnia and noticed significant palpitation at night when in the days I could finally get a regular sleep. It was during this time I thought about suicide, so many times, but whenever I saw my father lying in bed lecturing me to do a good job at school, I wanted to cry so badly and couldn't imagine what would do to him if I chose that easy path. Eventually, I took a semester off and returned to the US when things started to normalize.\r  \n\r\n\nFrom that semester forward, I managed to get all As in almost every class. If there's even a slight chance I can't get an A, I intentionally make it a D or an F so that I can retake it and improve my grade. \n\nNow, I'm in my last year at CCC, and all I can think about is my application to UC. Unfortunately, I couldn't do the Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) because they evaluated my GPA based on the order of courses I took. This means that even if I retake all the major courses, they won't count toward my cumulative GPA if my previous courses from the four-year college can be transferred to UC. Regardless of my performance at the community college, there is no chance I can get TAG from any UC. I have no guarantee of getting into any UC college, and I'm unsure if any school would even want me.  \n\nNevertheless, I'm taking life day by day now. I'm learning to focus on what's right in front of me. Even after all the setbacks, I still have a deep passion for studying physics, especially astrophysics. UCB has always been a dream school for me. If it wasn't for that lie, I'd be more than willing to spend another four years at a different CCC just to get into UCB and study astrophysics.\n\nCurrently, I hold a 3.1 GPA from CCC and a 1.18 from my previous university. As I contemplate my PiQ, I'm at a loss as to which part of my story to share. I don't even know if it's a personal drive pushing me or if I'm merely trying to meet my father's expectations. Sometimes I even felt proud of myself, being able to live through all that and still pretending to live like a normal person. Other times, I wonder if I'm still that same zombie from the earlier days, someone who no longer feels anything, and the As I'm earning is just me finally learning how to study effectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS. You might wonder why I didn't just drop the course. The thing is international students like me face minimum enrolled units restrictions. Dropping below that limit would jeopardize my visa status.\r You might also be wondering why my father still doesn't know after spending six years in a four-year college. Two years ago, I told him I was applying for a master's degree, but I got rejected by all of them. So I decided to change my major, extend the time needed for graduation, keep my visa, and try different programs at different schools. He was extremely disappointed that I was too afraid to go back home during the summer to face him.\r  \n\r  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4yuuqq66cvb1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab42eb2aaccc8d8f41b77c076ebc1610ab031f6b", "comments": [{"body": "Your best hope is your PIQ essays and picking a major with a high acceptance rate in the college of LS honestly.

Sources: Getty.\nOCTOBER 18, 2023\n\n\nSince william f. buckley published God and Man at Yale\u2014a best-selling book that criticized the \u201ccollectivist\u201d sympathies of professors at Buckley\u2019s alma mater\u2014in 1951, conservatives have argued that prestigious American universities are hotbeds of dangerous Marxist brainwashing. Whether espoused by Buckley in the \u201950s or by conservative firebrands today, the assertion that elite universities are sites of far-left indoctrination is and has always been a fantasy. The most popular major at Harvard, Yale, and many other supposedly leftist universities is economics\u2014not exactly the subject of choice for aspiring anti-capitalists. At the University of Pennsylvania, 50 percent of graduating students take jobs in finance or consulting. The figures at other Ivies aren\u2019t much lower. If these institutions are trying to produce Marxists, they are failing spectacularly.\n\nYet conservatives are right when they say that the Ivory Tower is a breeding ground for ideological extremism. The politics on offer at elite universities are not leftist in any substantive sense\u2014at least if by \u201cleftist\u201d you mean redistributive\u2014but they are radical. We might call it \u201ccorporate radicalism\u201d: a political sensibility that blends what the late writer Mark Fisher derisively referred to as \u201ccapitalist realism\u201d\u2014the conviction that free-market neoliberalism is broken but that there is no better alternative so we might as well embrace it\u2014with performative social justice that is as loud as it is toothless. Although academia has always been a haven for leftists, freethinkers, and creatives as well as crackpots, there used to be a kind of separation of church and state: Universities were refuges for radicals, but they were not themselves radical. (Consider the tensions between faculty and administrations during the campus protest movements of the 1960s.)\n\nIn recent years, however, college presidents, deans, and HR professionals have cribbed the language of edgy politics, openly framing their institutions and initiatives as aspirationally \u201canti-racist\u201d and \u201cdecolonial\u201d enterprises while welcoming \u201cscholar-activists\u201d: professors who see their research, political militancy, and pedagogy as mutually constitutive. You can see the fruit of this shift in a number of faculty members\u2019 responses to Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel earlier this month. Zareena Grewal, an American-studies professor at Yale, tweeted, \u201cSettlers are not civilians,\u201d implying that massacred Israelis couldn\u2019t be considered innocent. She also asserted that a young Israeli engineering student who had been kidnapped during a massacre at a rave shouldn\u2019t count as a noncombatant because she was \u201can IDF soldier/Israeli police officer.\u201d (Grewal has since locked her Twitter account.) Tenured and tenure-track professors at prestigious research institutions hastened to remind their Twitter followers that \u201cdecolonization is not a metaphor.\u201d The posts\u2014dated the same day as Hamas\u2019s attack\u2014quite plainly implied that decolonization necessarily entails terroristic violence.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: Students for Pogroms in Israel\n\nThe situation has proved to be a fiasco for elite colleges and universities, opening a new front in the ongoing culture war in higher education. The tension bursting into view right now\u2014between a majority of scholars, for whom \u201cdecolonization\u201d means putting fewer white Europeans on their syllabi, and a small minority who believe it entails anything-goes violent revolution\u2014is the unwelcome and unsurprising result of universities wanting to cosplay rebellion while still churning out Wall Street\u2013executive alumni who will one day pad endowments that are larger than Israel\u2019s annual defense budget.\n\nIn short, elite universities are in a bind, floundering in their attempts to navigate the Israel-Palestine conflict, because they have passed the better part of a decade making themselves political. If college presidents had not spent the past few years issuing watery, say-nothing statements about every crisis in current affairs, they would not now be expected to register their opinion on the conflagration in the Middle East. If they had not slapped the words decolonization and anti-racism on so many campus initiatives, they would not now be implicated as ideological co-conspirators every time one of their faculty members labels a terrorist attack \u201cdecolonization,\u201d or whenever an \u201canti-racist\u201d research institute is hit with a major scandal. And above all, if they had not indulged the preposterous notion that unpopular or even offensive ideas are a form of \u201cviolence\u201d that their students must be protected from, they would not now look so hypocritical when members of their campus community voice enthusiasm for actual violence. If universities had been more circumspect in the past, they could credibly say that they believe in academic freedom\u2014regardless of whatever administrators themselves may think of the ideas that their students and faculty champion\u2014and leave it at that.\n\nInstead, deluded into believing that the Ivory Tower could be both a site of social justice and a factory for finance bros, elite universities bit the poison apple of politics. Enter corporate radicalism.\n\nIoften describe myself as a \u201csoft Marxist.\u201d I say that because my politics slouch toward reformist social democracy, not revolutionary overhaul. But I am nonetheless a Marxist, because I hold the traditionally Marxist view that the ideas that dominate at a given place and time tend not to be the ideas of the working classes\u2014the humble majority\u2014but rather of the elites. \u201cThe class which is the ruling material force of society,\u201d Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels declared, \u201cis at the same time its ruling intellectual force.\u201d Though the conservative accusation that prestigious universities are \u201cculturally Marxist\u201d is little more than a conspiracy theory, ironically, Marxism can help us understand the ideologies that prevail at these institutions.\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective, there are only two possible explanations for the radical politics emerging out of Harvard and company: Either, against all odds, a genuinely revolutionary political project\u2014decolonization, anti-racism, etc.\u2014has been secreted out of the inner sanctum of the American elite to destabilize it from within, or these \u201cradical\u201d political ideologies are in fact little more than wallpaper serving the interests of the ruling class by morally laundering an education system that doles out advantages to the mediocre rich and then calls this process a \u201cmeritocracy.\u201d Although miracles are certainly possible, history\u2014and common sense\u2014militates in favor of the latter.\n\n1 of 2", "upvotes": 16}, {"body": "IMHO one of the main reasons why hard-core conservatives keep shitting on us (and education as a whole) can be boiled down to one simple reason...\n\nMany of us are bright and hopeful young people who want to change the future.

I am looking for someone who is able to adopt my cat and give her a good life. Theo came into my life a year ago. She has urinary retention issues, meaning she sometimes has episodes where she is not able to pee. She goes in and out of her litter box and when she sees she can't pee, she starts to squat in other \"safe spaces\" around our apartment. Small drops will come out, sometimes with blood, sometimes they are clear. These episodes vary in frequency, sometimes it only happens once a month, sometimes it is two times a week. My landlord has giving me an ultimatum due to her leaving pee on the bathroom baseboards (this is where I put her every time she has an episode so she doesn't do it on the rest of the apartment) and I've washed them before but some don't come out and they are accumulating. I am not able to afford a move so I'm desperately looking for someone who can take care of her. She is a great cat, very docile, wouldn't hurt a fly, and she is a total lap cat. She loves to be pet, she will sleep on the bed throughout the night, so she is not a noisy cat that won't let you sleep. She also has some mobility issues but they are not a big deal, she can still walk, run, and climb but she cannot jump too high, so the kitchen counters are save from her.

This is actually working because rational liberals/true progressives/moderate/conservative white people + people of other colors who had experiences with racist white liberals **UNITE** to dismantle the disillusioned left.  The 'so called liberals' can't think outside the left box and are resorting to making personal attacks at me (which further proves they are super annoying and stupid) because I presented an argument that goes against their agenda using a speech from one of their heroes -Malcom X. who I respect a lot\n\nAlso, I referred to white liberals as \"the most racist\" as a click-bait or trigger- trying to use the methodology the leftists often use to make an overgeneralization of every societal issues such as ex. 'women are better leaders than men' or 'Asian guys cannot drive well' (which can be true in most cases but not in an absolute term)\n\nThe thing is when I try to rationally debate (yes my major is stuff related to this) liberals, I fail to have a conversation because I'm racist/sexist/ignorant/privileged/international student with F1 visa ... a lot of liberals use logic based on feelings, emotions, experiences and ofc those are important and could be validated but shutting down any argument using 'I/someone feel offended' is going to get you nowhere.\n\nI wish we could restore liberalism, social justice, sustainable development to their true nature and cut out all the bs logic the left is pushing because that can destroy not just the US but the entire human civilization. I hope we stop absorbing whatever these old Professors are saying but question their belief/books/presentations/lectures because some are too old to keep up with what's going on in today's world-like why'd u trust an old man who can't even figure out how to use zoom or beam projector.\n\nI'm sorry but there are amazing Professors but they may not be the best source to learn about stuff like the effect of technology on our economy (talking about l&s prof )\n\n**response**:\n\nresponding to several comments about the pronoun part- I usually use 'they' to avoid misgendering and if I ask and confirm the person's gender, I try my best to use the correct pronoun\n\nresponding to generalizing white liberals- I think a lot of people are racist and I apologize for saying white liberals are the \"most racist\" because that's probably not true statistically but true in my experience (lived in different countries, cities and continents). I find too much hypocrisy from interacting with white \"liberals\"- I put this in quotation because they believe they are liberals but aren't. Both conservatives and liberals can be racist but it gets annoying when liberals think they know everything about race theory/history and accuse people of being racist when they are also being racist. Conservatives and moderates tend not to contextualize every American politics/economic/cultural/social/emotional issues under the race framework.\n\nThis is a quote Malcom X and he has a point that more people should read:\n\n>\"In this deceitful American game of power politics, the Negroes (i.e., the race problem, the integration and civil rights issues) are nothing but tools, used by one group of whites called Liberals against another group of whites called Conservatives, either to get into power or to remain in power. Among whites here in America, the political teams are no longer divided into Democrats and Republicans. The whites who are now struggling for control of the American political throne are divided into \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" camps. The white liberals from both parties cross party lines to work together toward the same goal, and white conservatives from both parties do likewise.  \n>  \n>The white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative. The liberal is more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor; and by winning the friendship, allegiance, and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or tool in this political \"football game\" that is constantly raging between the white liberals and white conservatives.  \n>  \n>Politically the American Negro is nothing but a football and the white liberals control this mentally dead ball through tricks of tokenism: false promises of integration and civil rights. In this profitable game of deceiving and exploiting the political politician of the American Negro, those white liberals have the willing cooperation of the Negro civil rights leaders. These \"leaders\" sell out our people for just a few crumbs of token recognition and token gains.

Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist known for his contributions to the development of nuclear weapons and later nuclear fusion research, found himself in a peculiar situation.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Oppenheimer was discussing the intricacies of nuclear fusion in a top-secret laboratory on the UC Berkeley campus. His colleagues and subordinates, who were often privy to the enigmatic world of atomic science, were conducting their experiments and calculations with utmost focus. The laboratory was abuzz with the hum of machinery and the gentle hum of scientists pondering over their equations, all within the ivy-covered walls of the prestigious university.\n\nIn the midst of a particularly intense discussion about the behavior of plasma in fusion reactors, a newly recruited young physicist named \"Squirrel\" entered the lab. He glanced around at the serious faces and complex apparatus and realized he had no idea what was happening.\n\nFeeling a bit lost and overwhelmed in the esteemed setting of UC Berkeley, Squirrel approached Oppenheimer, cleared his throat nervously, and finally asked, \"Excuse me, Dr. Oppenheimer, is this area safe?\"\n\nOppenheimer, known for his profound intellect and often cryptic humor, paused and gave the matter serious thought. He looked around at the radiation suits, the swirling magnetic fields, and the intimidating machinery, all within the storied walls of UC Berkeley. He then replied with a sly grin, \"Well, my young friend, as safe as can be expected when you're playing with the power of the stars on the hallowed grounds of this esteemed institution.\"\n\nThe entire laboratory, situated within the vibrant campus of UC Berkeley, burst into laughter, with Oppenheimer's response breaking the tension and reminding everyone that sometimes, even in the pursuit of the most complex and groundbreaking science, a good sense of humor can be a powerful tool.\n\nFrom that day forward, \"Is this area safe?\" became a running joke in the Oppenheimer lab, intertwined with the rich history of UC Berkeley. It was a reminder that when you're pushing the boundaries of human knowledge on a campus renowned for academic excellence, a little humor can go a long way to lighten the heavy burden of scientific discovery. It was a lesson that Oppenheimer and his team carried with them into the future, whether they were exploring the heart of the atom or seeking to unlock the secrets of nuclear fusion, all under the watchful gaze of UC Berkeley's iconic campanile.", "comments": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|yoJC2nt2jACN8swJSU)", "upvotes": 7}, {"body": "Truly one of the Reddit posts of all time", "upvotes": 6}, {"body": "TF did I just read?", "upvotes": 3}, {"body": "In which building was their lab located?

For example, school (both K-12 and colleges/universities) are legally (and morally) obligated to prevent harassment of and discrimination against Palestinian students.  \n\n\nThis is similar to how under Title IX, schools must prevent sexual harassment/assault and harassment of LGBTQ+ students, since both are examples of sex-based discrimination; schools similarly must prevent harassment of Palestinian students, faculty, staff, etc - and not just in housing!  \n\n\nFor example, if an [elected official brandishes a gun](https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-councilwoman-inna-vernikov-arrested-after-openly-carrying-firearm-at-brooklyn-college-rally) on campus in order to intimidate Palestinian students, the school has a legal and moral obligation to prevent further harassment (e.g. by banning the perpetrator from campus, regardless of whether or not it was a crime to brandish the gun on campus); the same applies to brandishing a knife in the dorms - or elsewhere - in an attempt to intimidate Palestinian students.  \n\n\nIn the case of college housing, housing civil rights laws provide additional legal prohibitions against discrimination against Palestinian students. (And of course, these laws also cover non-college housing.)  \n\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that just becausec the law prohibits something bad, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be meaningfully enforced against perpetrators; for example, the University of California and   \nUC Berkeley have a notorious history of illegally allowing and even directly perpetuating anti-Palestinian bigotry/oppression.

The campus had become the unlikely stage for the first-ever \"Squirrellympics,\" a sporting extravaganza of epic proportions that would be told for generations.\n\nThe red squirrels, famed for their nimbleness, gathered on one end of the 1,232-acre campus. These pint-sized acrobats, with their tails stretching up to 20cm (8 inches), were about to embark on a squirrel-sized revolution. They had a plan - and it was a plan of colossal proportions. They calculated that they could fit an astonishing 113,427,748 red squirrels into the campus. How? They decided to form the world's tallest squirrel pyramid. You could barely see the campus anymore; it had transformed into a squirrel skyscraper. The spectacle had everyone in stitches, and the world had never seen anything quite like it.\n\nOn the opposite end of the campus, the grey squirrels, who were larger and had tails of up to 25cm (10 inches), had their own trick up their sleeves. They organized a \"Squirrel Rocket Race\" to take over the world. The campus quaked as they built squirrel-powered rockets, ready to launch them to the moon and back. With space for 73,922,828 grey squirrels, their rocket squad looked like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. The countdown began, and they shot toward the stars, leaving a trail of nuts and acorns in their cosmic wake.\n\nAmidst the chaos, a wise old squirrel named Sir Nuts-a-Lot had an epiphany. He realized that the real prize wasn't about squirrel skyscrapers or squirrel rockets. It was about the laughter, camaraderie, and nutty fun shared among friends. With tails held high and laughter in their hearts, he invited all the squirrels to join in the world's longest squirrel conga line.\n\nRed squirrels and grey squirrels danced together, their tails forming an unbroken link that stretched across the campus. As they danced and laughed, they understood that the size of your tail or your ambition didn't matter; it was the joy of living in the moment that truly counted. The echoes of their laughter rang through the 1,232-acre campus, leaving a memory etched in the hearts of all squirrels, a reminder that joy is always worth celebrating, tails held high.

You might want to get comfortable for this read cus it's gona be long one, but hopefully it will be helpful to you and anyone that is in the same transition period you are in.\n\nI'll start all the way in the beginning.  When I graduated in the winter of 2018, it took me about month to mentally recovered from finally graduating from cal.  But one day, I finally found myself awake, staring at the ceiling, asking myself the dreadful \"now what?\"  At first I really didn't know where to start, other than the most logical first step to me, which was start working on my resume.  I was a transfer student that came in majoring in econ, but switched to applied math after my first year.  So I spent my summers catching up on courses, meaning I was not able to work in an internship(not that I looked for them anyway, cal was about all I could handled).  So I really started from square one.  Back in 2018, US had historically low unemployment rate, and it still took me about 7 months to find me first full time job.  So the good news for you is, what you are experience is not out of the norm.  Like many things, the beginning is always the toughest, so hang in there.\n\nWhile working on my resume at my parents' house, I realized I have no money lol.  So when I made that realization.  I reached out to my old boss at my junior college and asked for my old tutoring job back.  Luckily, I left on very good terms when I transferred, and a cal math grad was pretty alluring at a junior college, so I got my old job back working about 20 hours a week.  Which brings me to my first point, which is get a job, any job(if you haven't already), especially ones like tutoring which allows you to have flexibility to learn new skills and work on applying are especially great.  While all the grads here know what an achievement it is to graduate from cal, the first thing I had to learn was that at that point in time, it no longer matters.\n\nJust like you don't want be the guy bragging about his/her time in high school in college, college is your past now.  You are a \"real\" adult now.  That image of the person you want to be \"when you grow up\", now is the time to put in the work to BE that person.  I say that because it is easy to think working in a grocery store, or McD is beneath you as a cal grad.  But, it really is not.  Having a part time job like that gives the structure a recent grad sorely needs, while still allowing enough time to work on getting a \"real\" job.  Not to mention, you get paid, which will do wonders with that self esteem issues.  It also sends  a message to your strict parents you are trying and aren't being a deadbeat.  As hard as it is to hear, trying to get a job you think you deserved is not sufficient excuse to not pay for the food you're eating, because that IS beneath you as a cal grad.  While I was working as a tutor, I had a lot of down time.  So I learned excel, I took cs61a online by watching denero's videos on youtube, and using the online resources from previous year, I learned anything that I thought made me more employable.  It is natural to have skill gaps when you just graduate, the time between your first job and graduation can be very valuable in acquiring skills that you get you employed and paid.  Even then I realized, there aren't many situations in life where I can just study because I want to, and have the TIME to do so.\n\nWhile I was working as a tutor and learning more skills, I was also sending out resume like crazy.  I find that it's important to have a hard number to stick to.  For me it was at least 20 resume a day.  I quickly find that it's more important that I send the resume out instead of making my resume perfect or a company I want.  It really is a numbers game, if you're not sending enough out, you're just not going to get interviews.  I liked sites liked zip recruiters a lot because it had a 1 click apply option when you upload your resume.  So when I wasn't working, or learning, I was scrolling job sites like reddit, applying for jobs.\n\nSo I basically followed the routine of going to work, study, and applying for jobs, going to interviews when I got them, this continued for like 7 months before I landed a job as a data analyst at this traffic data gathering company, the pay was 33k a year.  I live in Diamond bar at this point, and the job was in culver city.  My salary was clearly not enough to move out on, and it takes almost 2 hours of driving to get there in the morning, and almost as long to get back.  The job clearly sucks, so it'd be stupid to take it right?  WRONG, you're just not gona get your dream job right off the bat, and if you're honest with yourself, you're probably not that qualify for it even if you did get it.  Yeah the job sucks, and I knew i can do better, but it was still an improvement over my part time job by the virtue that it paid more and it's something I can put on my resume.  However, almost 4 hours of commute was extremely wasteful if I want to continue to expand my skillset and look for a better job.  So, I did the math.  I begin waking up at 4:30am every morning, drive for about 40 minutes to culver city.  Then I would find a space and park, sleep until 7, got to a nearby starbucks and learn data analysis and wrangling techniques in python, then go to work at 9.  All in the while, I was still scrolling job site like reddit, still applying, while updating my skillset and resume.  Another 1.5 months went by, a friend I know from junior college and also went to cal with told me about her firm is hiring.  I applied, and got the job, which was in century city(even farther than culver city).

It is absolutely horrific and disgusting to see some people trying to justify/ contextualize this atrocity. It is absolutely insane that me as an Asian woman in Berkeley is against anti-semitism and is troubled by the fact that some of these \"so called liberals\"/communists/marxists/socialists/ feminists/ environmentalists/ college professors/ media outlets/\"so called progressives\" students are ignoring and refusing to condemn egregious human right abuses/ terrorism/ mass genocide. At this point, people standing up for women rights/ lgbtq rights/ black peoples rights/ animal rights/ environmental protection rights and AT THE SAME TIME thinking it's kinda okay to mass murder babies and rape women is INSANE. NO sane human being would find kidnapping babies and posting videos on social media of massacring innocent babies acceptable. This is not just a crime against Jews. IT IS CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. \n\nI cannot believe that I, as an ASIAN WOMAN, am being \"cancelled\" in Berkeley ...because I speak about my feelings and opinions- I thought we were supposed to tolerate whatever emotion a human being has but NO only certain emotions are valid. It is frightening that I cannot participate in class or write an essay that actually reflect my thoughts because I get angry faces from my classmates and I have to write exactly what the Professor has said to get good grades- ironically, I am supposed to be creative and input my analysis but having diverse perspective is no longer acceptable. \n\nI talked to my friends at Cal yesterday and today about Hamas. It is so brutally frustrating that my friends who haven't read a single article/wikipedia page/asked chatGPT and don't know what's happening - talk as if they know everything from seeing Instagram posts. Hatred towards Jews is so embedded in peoples\u2019 minds that it's hard to have a healthy discourse around the Israel-Palestinian conflict. I could be unfriended if I make a comment about Hamas being a terrorist organization or if I just ask a question out of curiosity. It's dangerous to see how young people (this also applies to me) today are so so ignorant and irrational but we are soooooo overly confident and obnoxious and  arrogant about our college degree and being \"educated\" - we think we were taught to think but we were taught to absorb whatever a teacher or celebrity or politician or youtuber or influencer felt and said.\n\nOur society ,at least here in college, think we are morally upright but at the same time we allow or try to sort give grounds for terrorism and resign to immorality. We lost our capacity to think and we sleep on mass atrocities. We are utterly blinded when the sun rise. There is Truth and there is Morality in this world. We need to learn to think and question- to think independently and critically. \n\nOur society has become more divisive because we no longer see what the root cause of the issues are. Institutions, governments, schools, organization have put blinds in our windows because they don\u2019t really care about us even if they think they do care about us. They stir and fuel more hatred and anger. We need to start asking what the real problem is. We have become a society where asking a harmless question such as 'do you think affirmative action is racist? or 'do you think the US has better women's rights than Afghanistan?'' itself is being racist and sexist. Asking a question (because I am dumb and curious) means I'm being offensive and hateful?? Where do you draw the line with hate speech and free speech? My friends tell me asking such questions can hurt people's feelings because of my intention- I had 0 intention of being racist/ sexist and HOW DARE YOU ASSUME MY INTENTION and MY IDENTITY? The 'WOKE' culture has done their job making me WOKE and making me finally see how hypocritical, nasty, disgusting these politicians, celebrities, journalists, the elites are. We need to start waking up to realize what Hamas did is\u00a0a crime-a crime against humanity and our society not recognizing it as a crime is a crime.
