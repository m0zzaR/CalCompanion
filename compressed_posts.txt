The article discusses a protest by UC Berkeley students to reinstate Professor Ivonne del Valle, who was suspended for stalking. The students are threatening a hunger strike, and some argue that she may have had a mental breakdown.
Sounds good, let's meet at the Campanile at 3:30! Can't wait to play catch and/or a game with y'all.
The post and comments discuss the interconnectedness of domestic and foreign issues, particularly the Israel/Palestinian conflict. Some argue that America's involvement in the conflict is driven by neo-colonial undertones, while others believe that America has led almost every effort to establish a peace accord. The sentiment across the comments is that the conflict is a tragedy and that people care about these issues for good reasons.
Yeah, it seems like Berkeley time is a common issue for many students and faculty. It's especially tricky during interviews and can cause confusion with meeting times. It's important to keep in mind the unique time system at Berkeley to avoid being late or misunderstood.
Based on the information provided, it seems that the ideal time to start looking for housing for the 24-25 school year is in March, with some people starting as early as February. It is also suggested that it may be beneficial to wait until closer to August to secure housing, as vacancies may become available and prices may be negotiable. It is important to consider the potential risks of signing a lease too early, such as termination fees if the housing plans change.
Well, it seems like the author of this post had a less than ideal experience at the McDonalds in downtown Berkeley. They left their food unattended and it was stolen, which is probably why the homeless guy thought it was up for grabs. It's a good thing that their friend was able to get it back, though. And it's not like they could have avoided the sketchy situation by just getting their food to go, because they were already in the middle of eating it.
I agree with the sentiment of the first comment, it would be inappropriate to ask for the GSI's workout routine during class. The second comment seems indifferent, while the third comment advises against it. The fourth comment seems to have seen a similar post before.
It's cold outside, but people are still wearing light clothing. Some say it's because of alcohol, while others mention fashion. It's not just a problem for ladies, but for everyone. Some people even claim that hoes don't get cold. It's not that cold in the bay yet, but people are probably drinking or getting high to ignore the cold. Vodka blanket is a solution, but it's not the only one.
MCB 102 is a memorization-heavy class, with an average midterm score of ~60%. Reviewing old chem material and using flashcards/mnemonics can help. It's recommended to take the class as soon as possible if it's required for your major, but pushing it to the next semester or summer/fall break could be an option if you're feeling unprepared.
The CS61 midterm seemed to be a mixed experience for some students. One student felt unfairly disadvantaged by a question being placed after an A+ question, while another felt it was fine.
The question of whether or not to use the Soda software for the ship project has been debated by the team, with some members advocating for its use and others expressing concerns about its complexity and potential impact on the project's timeline. Ultimately, the team decided to stick with their original plan and use a different software for the project.
The question asks for career options outside of academia for a person with a PhD in English. Some answers suggest teaching, editing, publishing, HR, recruiting, and writing. The sentiment across the answers is that there are many opportunities available, but one should be willing to put in the effort to seek them out.
The question is about getting into ML labs with A+ in 126 and 127 but no 189. The answer suggests that for some professors in BAIR, doing CS 189 is the bare minimum.
It seems like some people might not understand basic hygiene, like washing hands after using the restroom or covering their mouth when they cough/sneeze. Some people might not care, while others might just not know any better. It's important to stay safe and healthy, especially during flu season.
That aerial announcement for Israel sure sparked some controversy, huh? It seems like some people think it's a counterproductive move, while others disagree. What do you think?
Average sentiment: The post is about the hotness of people on campus, and Oski being the only bear mascot.
The sentiment in the comments is mixed, with some people advising to drop the class, while others encourage taking it despite its difficulty. One comment mentions John Kubiatowicz's plans to make the class challenging. The class in question is CS 162, and it seems that some students are trying to get in or are on the waitlist.
Don't worry, they usually open up more sections during winter break. Try emailing Lucia Briggs, the chem enrollment coordinator, and ask her to notify you when they add new sections.
It seems like there's a lot of admiration for the hot professors at Berkeley, with some people even noticing their muscles and fitness. One commenter mentioned a math professor who is also a bodybuilder, and another mentioned a professor who works at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Overall, it seems like people are appreciating the physical attractiveness of the professors at Berkeley.
The question is about the noise level in Moffit library, with some users suggesting that it's too loud and others pointing out that it's a socializing area. Some users also mention other quiet libraries on campus.
I'm cookin' up a parody of Drake's "What Would Pluto Do" called "What Would Python Do" all about CS61A Python interpreter questions.
Can everyone in Main Stacks SHUT UP? Go to Moffit if you want to talk. Some people never learned that there is an inside voice. Pepper spray them. They won't respond to polite requests.
Just ask your housemates for some privacy with your girlfriend, suggesting a time that works for everyone. Offering to reimburse them for a meal or a movie out is a nice touch. If they're cool, they'll likely say yes. Alternatively, consider getting a hotel for the day for some alone time.
lol wow, sounds like a wild time in the CS lounge. Maybe I should drop by and see what's up!
It seems like the OP is struggling with their studies and major at Berkeley, and is considering withdrawing from the university. Some commenters suggest taking time off, switching majors, or taking classes online. Others suggest that withdrawing is a viable option, and that it's important to prioritize one's well-being. It's unclear what the OP's major is, but it seems like they are struggling with classes in their major.
The Moffitt rooms are not soundproof, according to a comment from someone who used to study in one of the rooms.
I'm surprised too, it seems like people are always trying to leave through emergency exit doors. Maybe they're just not paying attention or are scared of setting off alarms.
As an autistic person, I'd say that that's a massive fucking W. The rollerblading girl made eye contact and it's a big deal for me.
hey, it sounds like you're considering your options for the summer if you don't secure an internship. It's great to hear that you're thinking about personal projects and open source contributions. It might also be helpful to take summer courses or consider other types of employment, like working at a summer camp. Remember to take some time for yourself and enjoy your last bit of free time before the next school year begins.
You can still register for the Fall 2023 graduation and submit a form stating that you don't need to attend classes for Spring semester. However, your physical diploma will be sent in October and any verifications will show Spring 2024 instead of Fall 2023.
The original poster shared their struggles with finding friends and fitting in at Cal, despite joining clubs and taking classes in their major. Some commenters suggested trying new social hobbies or diversifying away from the tech field, while others shared their own experiences with finding friends outside of their major or through unexpected events. Overall, the sentiment was to keep trying new things and being open to unexpected connections.
Xfinity is having an outage and it's supposed to be fixed by 5 PM today. Some people are upset about it, but it might be possible to request compensation in the form of credit for the next bill.
The article discusses a situation where Ivonne del Valle, a tenured associate professor of colonial studies, accused Joshua Clover, a professor of English and comparative literature, of harassing her. The dispute started with a tweet from Clover that del Valle considered as a personal attack. Del Valle then approached Clover and accused him of harassing her. Clover denied the allegations and reported the incident to the university. The university investigated the incident and found del Valle guilty of violating the university's policy on discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. The article also mentions that del Valle had previously been accused of mistreating students and that the "Justice for Ivonne" protests were in support of her.
The trash on Sproul is a common problem, not just from the protest. It's important to clean up after ourselves and be mindful of our impact on the environment.
Hey there! It seems like a lot of people are struggling to make friends at UC Berkeley, including myself. It's tough to find a community here, but some of us are trying to change that by creating a group chat and a private subreddit. If you're interested in joining, DM me and I'll invite you!
So I was on campus tonight around 7 and there was something like a fundraiser going on in front of Doe, and then suddenly it was raided with around 80-100 protestors chanting “Carol Christ is protecting sexual harasser” with posters and banners. Does anyone know what that's all about?
If we are going to protest administrators for failing to respond properly to abuse, I would suggest focusing on the Athletic director Jim Knowlton who failed to properly respond to Teri McKeever's abuse of many women's swim team members. Unlike Carol, he has not announced he is retiring, so working to get him pushed out will make more of a difference.
Hey! It seems like a lot of people are struggling to make friends at Berkeley, especially as transfers. It's important to remember that it can take time to build those connections, and it's not uncommon to feel left out or lonely. Some suggestions include taking Decal classes, providing value to potential friends, and trying to connect with people in class or clubs. Don't give up, and remember that you're not alone in this!
Lol, it seems like there's a mix of people going to the Travis Scott concert on Nov. 1st and those who aren't. One person is trying to make a group to go together, but it's unclear if anyone else is interested.
The professor is being criticized for offering extra credit to students who attend pro-Palestine protests. The offer is seen as a violation of the First Amendment and a form of compelled speech. The professor's actions have sparked a heated debate, with some supporting her stance on free speech and others calling for her to be reprimanded or banned from teaching.
The question above is about the percentage of Junior Computer Science majors who get a tech internship. One person received an offer after applying 600 times, while another is still waiting for an offer. The third comment suggests that it's a good time to apply for internships and to not give up, even if it means falling behind in classes.
The post describes a situation where the author's squirrelfriend screams "Berkeley" instead of the author's name during intimate moments. The author is hurt and stressed, and the post seeks advice on whether this behavior is normal. The post is a copy-paste from Reddit and has no question or answer.
The question is about the best strategy for getting into CS classes during the adjustment period in January, when declaring CS as a major. The answers suggest that showing up to classes and keeping up with the material, as well as staying on top of GSI hiring, can increase the chances of getting into popular classes like 61C and 170. One user also suggests using a bot to repeatedly try to register for classes until a spot opens up.
This post is about a girl who is obsessed with UC Berkeley and screamed the school's name instead of her boyfriend's name during sex. The boyfriend is hurt and unsure if it's normal. Some comments suggest it's normal, while others suggest it's unhealthy and the girl might be manifesting the school through sex magic.
Two helicopters are circling campus due to media coverage of a walkout and potential protests related to a controversial academic offering extra credit for pro-Palestine protests.
The helicopters are not related to the Palestine student walkout at 12:30. They are for media coverage of the event. The walkout is organized by the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS). One academic offered extra credit for attending pro-Palestine protests.
The piece of land in question is the "Fernwald" property, which was designated "Smyth / Fernwald" by the University. The house on the property was built in the 1860s and remodeled in an English Tudor style by architect Julia Morgan in 1911. The man who commissioned the remodel, William Smyth, was an eccentric English engineer who made a fortune as an inventor and patent consultant. He willed the property to the University before he died in the 1930s. The University hastily built several two-story dormitories for women students on the property in the 1940s, which were later converted to family student apartments in the 1970s. The dormitories were torn down in the 1990s, leaving most of the property vacant. The Hayward Fault runs through the lower part of the property, so it's no longer allowed to build there.
This post is about the author's admiration for the numerous attractive males at their school, and the comments are a mix of jokes, skepticism, and misinterpretation.
$20,000 in debt after four years is considered very manageable, especially for data science majors. The cost of attendance increases may be due to living in a more expensive dorm, but moving out of dorms and securing high-paying jobs after graduation can help pay off the debt quickly.
This job posting is a humorous take on the hiring process, with a focus on the unique and eccentric requirements of the position as Oski the Bear's trainer. The ad highlights the need for a bear psychology degree, experience in a similar role, and the ability to handle high-pressure situations.
The suspect grabbed a female victim from behind, picked her up off the ground, and licked her from neck to eye. The victim fled and a bystander intervened. The suspect is in custody for an unrelated case.
The question is about a high school student struggling with recursion in the CS 61A class at Berkeley. The answer suggests practicing with exams and discussion sheets from CS61A.org and using the "leap of faith" technique to solve recursive problems, with an example given for adding two to a positive number.
"Is it bad to make a move on my GSI" asks the girl who dropped his class three weeks ago due to personal issues. The comments section is divided, with some suggesting that she should go for it, while others express concern and sarcasm.
I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to provide a meaningful summary. Please provide more context or a specific question for me to assist you.
The question is about the opening date of a boba place called The Alley. The first answer confirms that the place is good, while the second answer mentions that they have multiple locations to try out.
The post asks about the reopening of Blaze Pizza, but both comments state that it has permanently closed.
The struggle is real, but there's hope. Some classes will be expanded, but who knows by how much. Let's hope for the best and cross our fingers.
Squirrels at Berkeley?! The campus is infested with them! I've never seen so many pretty ones in my life. They're all so genetically blessed, it's like they're from another planet. I'm in awe every time I enter the school.
Agreed, the number of pretty girls at Berkeley is indeed endless. The comments suggest that one should admire them, but also be mindful of creepiness. Perry and Dogg's monograph on the subject is also mentioned, although the methodology is questionable. The tag should be CS/EECS, and college is a great place to find a partner. Underconfident men should shoot their shot but avoid being creepy.
The post is about Teaspoon Berkeley finally opening and the author expressing their excitement. In the comments, one person says they've been going every day since it opened, and another asks what's good there.
Everyone's noticing that Campanile is running slightly ahead, which is causing some extra Berkeley time. Physics Prof even mentioned it in class.
Congrats on getting accepted to the Master of Information and Cybersecurity program starting in January 2024! It's great to hear that you're excited and looking for buddies. If you're interested in software, there might be some overlap with the Computer Science program.
The Cal football game day experience includes limited parking options, no tailgating allowed on campus, alcohol sales only on the west side of the stadium, and plenty of food options around campus. To make the experience fluid, consider taking BART, wearing blue and gold, and avoiding red.
The poster is trying to identify a food they ate with their ex in the Asian ghetto. They remember it being chewy and not sweet, and think it might be related to palatalikalu. They are considering a dish called Tteok-bokki, but have not confirmed it yet. Other commenters suggest Rice Rolls and Kimchi Garden's Spicy Dukbokki without eggs and fish.
I agree with the sentiment that holding doors for people is a great way to spread positivity. It's especially appreciated when someone goes out of their way to hold the door open for a longer period of time, like in the library. It's also understandable that sometimes it can be difficult to keep the door open for a large group of people, but it's always appreciated when someone tries.
The question of when Mainstacks became a talking library has been answered by stating that Mainstacks is a quiet space and people should not be talking or drinking anything other than water. If there are any issues with noise, the student security workers or info desk can be reached for assistance.
Congrats to everyone who got into the MIDS Program! Let's connect and share our experiences. The Spring 2024 Cohort has been accepted and some have signed their Statement of Intent to Register. Excited courses in the first term include data science classes.
Yes, it appears that the hourly chime on the campanile has been 2 minutes early today.
I'm glad you all enjoyed the video! To answer your question, these termites were observed swarming near Lower Hearst on the UC Berkeley campus. They are a species that prefers to live in the ground and are not typically dangerous to human-built structures. They do, however, provide a valuable food source for birds and other insects.
The question is about the workload of CS 161, Data 100, and Data 140. The first comment mentions that they are taking CS 161 and Data 100 and found that it's not too bad in terms of workload, but Data 140 seems like a heavy class. The second comment agrees with the first comment and adds that it depends on one's math and CS ability. Overall, the sentiment is that the workload of the classes mentioned is manageable, but it depends on one's ability and the time of the year (exam period).
The question is about choosing the best combination of classes to prepare for quant interviews next fall, given the options of taking EECS 126 and 127 together, or taking EECS 126 and a different class like Stat 140, and taking EECS 189 alone in the fall. The answers suggest that taking all three classes may be doable, and that Stat 140 and Data 100 may be more helpful than EECS 126 and CS 189.
The tea club discord has been announced for spring 2024, and it seems that everyone is welcome to join, including tea totalers and milktea enthusiasts. The discord link can be found in the original post.
The post discusses the suspicious behavior of several middle-aged white men approaching the author consecutively in Berkeley, leading to concerns about potential sex trafficking. Comments suggest reporting the incidents to UCPD and being cautious of job opportunities that seem too good to be true. One commenter recommends the "you're wrong about" podcast for a deeper understanding of sex trafficking statistics.
It seems like the best advice is to consider taking CS 189 earlier, and in the meantime, work on personal ML projects and research papers. Additionally, exploring less popular labs may be a good option.
The poster is asking for help in finding their missing dog, a 7 year old chihuahua mix named Toaster. The dog is microchipped but doesn't have a collar and is about the size of a medium/large cat. The poster is willing to distribute flyers and is looking for help in spreading the word.
Average sentiment across all answers: "Termites are the culprit for the sudden bug population boom after the rain, and they can cause significant damage to homes and structures."
They're called whiteflies and they show up after it rains. Some people think they're a sign of humid or rainy weather to come.
The student is considering taking Econ 100A but is worried about the math requirements. Other students have reassured them that the math is not too difficult and that the class is worth taking despite their concerns.
Hey there! So the student is concerned about their grades, particularly their midterm grades in Data 8 and Math 1A. They got a 25% on their Data 8 midterm and are failing the class, while their Math 1A midterm score was also low. They're not sure how to study effectively and are going to tutoring but still feel like they don't fully understand the material. Some comments suggest that the grades may not mean much without context and that they should practice for the final exams. Others suggest time management and effective note-taking as key study skills. Overall, the comments are supportive and encourage the student to keep working hard and not be too discouraged.
The question is whether to retake Math1b with Paulin next semester or not. The sentiment across the comments is that it is a tough class, but with effort, one can pass. It is recommended to take the late drop option and try to do better in the next semester.
The correlation between ethnicity and the likelihood to choose high salary majors (EECS, CS, Data Science, Economics) at Berkeley is examined. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients are calculated. Average sentiment across comments suggests that the correlation is not strong enough to indicate a clear pattern.
It seems like most people agree that BART can be a bit sketchy late at night, but as long as you stay aware of your surroundings and plan out your route, you should be fine. Just be sure to pay attention to announcements at SFO and avoid getting on the last two cars of the train.
It seems like maintaining a 3.5 GPA in MCB at Berkeley can be challenging, but definitely doable with hard work and good study habits. Some people found it easier to adjust to the workload than others, and there are different strategies for success, such as utilizing office hours and downloading everything you are assigned to read into your brain. It's also worth noting that the difficulty of the major can play a role in GPA, with some majors being more challenging than others.
Bruh moment indeed. The campus is full of them. Pee humor is not free, it comes at a cost. The cleaning crew has to deal with it. And who knows, maybe R Kelly works for BPD now.
Same here! It seems like there's interest in creating a tea club. Let's see what the IG group is all about!
I would recommend taking Data 140 over Stat 134, as it is better structured and more applied to coding. However, if you are struggling with CS 61B and have other classes to balance, you may want to consider taking Stat 134 instead. Ultimately, it depends on your goals and what you want to get out of the class.
I'm not sure who the rollerblading girl is, but it seems like she's popular on campus. Maybe you can try asking around or posting on social media to see if anyone knows who she is.
Theft of cars is unfortunately common in the Bay Area, including from the Clark Kerr parking lot. While wheel locks can deter thieves, it's important to be aware of the prevalence of car theft and take necessary precautions. UCPD and BPD are limited in their ability to chase stolen vehicles, so it's important to take steps to protect your own property.
The Berkeley petition to allow alumni to keep their email IDs seems to have been successful, with graduating students being able to claim their [alumni.ucdavis.edu](https://alumni.ucdavis.edu) email addresses. Berkeley alumni can also keep their [berkeley.edu](https://berkeley.edu) email addresses if claimed before September 6, 2023.
Same here, it seems like eduroam is having issues at random times. Let's hope it gets fixed soon!
The difficulty of upper division molecular biology courses at Berkeley varies. MCB 102 is known to be challenging, while other courses like MCB 140 are considered manageable with consistent study. The content can move fast, but keeping up with assignments and attending lectures is key to success.
Cool! I'm glad you found some good recs. Yeah, Cronenberg is a master of body horror. If you're into that, you should check out Videodrome and Scanners.
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with your LinkedIn profile pic. Some options you might consider include the Career Center on Bancroft, which offers free headshots with a grayish background, or the NRHH's free headshot events happening at Foothill, Clark Kerr, and Martinez Commons. Alternatively, you could always ask a friend or family member to take a photo for you.
The question is about the best major for pre-law to maintain a good GPA. The answers suggest that it doesn't matter much what major you choose, but to focus on working hard and choosing a major that interests you. One commenter recommends rhetoric as a good major for pre-law.
Ah, the elusive Berkeley EECS shirt. It appears to be a prized possession among the student body, with some even going as far as to claim it as a "Woman Repellant™". It seems that the shirt is given out for free during freshman year, and one can also find it on the website <https://www.dannyduncan69.com/products/virginity-rocks-yellow-tee> if they're lucky enough.
The P and R shuttle are not active on weekends, as per the information available on the Berkeley Bear Transit website.
Sometimes, it's okay to give up on a difficult major and find happiness in a new one. It's important to listen to yourself and prioritize your mental health over the expectations of others.
The question is whether there is any downside to applying for the Mechanical Engineering and Business (MET) program at UC Berkeley. The answer suggests that the admission rate for MET is highly competitive, and that applying to MET over MechE does not necessarily increase admission chances. However, MET students are typically highly qualified and passionate about both engineering and business, and the program is highly demanding. It is recommended to only apply to MET if it is a dream program for the applicant. Additionally, it is noted that Haas is moving to four-year admission for the incoming class of Fall 2024, and there are only 250 outright Haas spots, compared to around 50 for MET.
It's not weird to ask your freshman year roommates to room together again for sophomore year. In fact, it's better to ask than to regret not asking later. One person suggested waiting a few months before asking, but overall the sentiment is positive and encourages asking.
The question is about job opportunities with a psychology BA, and the answers suggest that there are various options such as behavior technician, marketing, HR, data analysis, and research assistant. Some of these jobs may require additional skills like data analysis or programming, and some may offer higher salaries with more experience.
No need to hold on, we're just pulling into the station. The conversation seems to be about a funny post in Spanish on a bus, with people joking about stopping the bus and holding on to something.
It seems like the course CS 285 at UC Berkeley has undergone some changes recently, with the addition of written homework and a decrease in the number of A grades being given out. The GSIs and instructors appear to be struggling to keep up with the increased workload and technical questions from students.
It seems that the Campanile clock is off by 2 minutes and the reasons for this could be due to a lack of payment for the people in charge or it needs to be serviced. The earth's rotation may also be affected by global warming, but this is not a likely explanation.
Hey there! It looks like you're interested in finding some friends and trying out different activities. Some people have offered to go for a hike or grab boba, while others are curious about your interests. Let's see if we can find some common ground and plan something fun!
The taste of water in Cory/Wheeler/Stanley Hall is reportedly unpleasant, possibly due to high alkalinity and mineral content, and may be exacerbated by aging pipes and disinfection methods.
The question asks for the classes with the most attractive people next semester. The answers suggest that psychology, education, and dance classes might have a good number of attractive people. Additionally, EECS 126 and CS162 are mentioned as potential options. The sentiment of the answers is generally positive, with a focus on helping the original poster find attractive people in their classes.
Average sentiment: It's tough out there, but keep applying and consider alternative options like temp agencies. Someone even suggested building a new job-hunting platform that's more efficient and transparent.
The original poster is feeling very depressed and struggling with their classes, feeling a lot of disappointment and failure. Commenters suggest seeking help from counseling and psych services, taking a break to focus on oneself, changing habits and lifestyle, and remembering that it's okay to stumble and believe in the journey. One commenter shared their personal experience of being on academic probation multiple times and still graduating.
Bruh, the 1a midterm is a pain in the ass. Everyone hates the weeder course mentality. Wish they had just taken the exam in school and used the credit to escape this madness.
Aunt Pooeys is a popular choice for chocolate cake, but it's far from campus. Other options include Sheng Kee, Masse's Pastries, and Safeway.
Obama was spotted near Li Ka Shing, but it was likely Oski in disguise. The person in the Oski suit was actually Obama the whole time. Helicopters were circling all afternoon.
The incident at Berkeley High School involved a group of students fighting and causing chaos, including the use of firecrackers, eggs, and BB guns. There were no reports of gunshots being fired. The incident was covered by ScanBerkeley and resulted in two injuries, but no arrests or detentions. There was also a separate incident at BART around 30 minutes later that caused disruption to the Red Line.
Kalx is Berkeley's radio station, and it's playing at the foothill cafeteria today. The music is going hard and it's a Foothill party at 7pm.
I agree with the other commenters that the UI design of classes.berkeley.edu is poor, especially the way it reloads the entire page every time a filter is changed. It would be better if the options settings were at the top and there was a submit button for manual submission. Additionally, it's worth noting that the UI of UCPath, a software used by the University of California, is also nearly unusable, and the admin who approved its use should be held accountable.
Hi there! I'm also interested in finding a walk buddy and a gym buddy. I'm free on Fridays and I love walking around Berkeley and checking out the shops. If you're interested in chatting or meeting up, feel free to DM me!
Wtf was that? Someone screaming on northside Berkeley. Turns out it was just a fox. Phew.
The comments above express frustration and difficulty with a class and its material, specifically with asymptotics and a curve. Some students were only able to answer a small portion of the questions and were unsure of their correctness. The sentiment is generally negative, with a desire for a higher grade and a feeling that the class has become like an IQ test.
The poster is looking for someone to adopt their special needs cat, Theo, who has urinary retention issues. Commenters suggest using enzyme cleaners, trying foster care, reaching out to specialized rescues, and using a urinary diet and gel to help with the cat's condition.
Math 110 seems to be the most popular answer among the comments, with some mentioning Elementary Topology as a possible alternative. The question asks for the easiest upper division math class, and the comments suggest that Math 110 is a good choice due to its relatively low difficulty compared to other upper division math classes.
"What's exciting you lately? Comments include going to the gym, LeBron James, a new piano at MLK, and UCB. The sentiment is mostly neutral."
If you're in a situation where your scooter was stolen and you have an airtag attached to it, it's best to file a police report first and then go to the location where the airtag is with someone else. UCPD non-emergency number is (510) 642-6760. It's important to have proof of purchase to show ownership of the scooter.
The class Chinese 186 is perceived as easy to get an A in, with the professor being chill and approachable. One student asked if the class was easy to get an A in, to which another student responded that it was.
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The original post is not about genuine concern but rather a generalization of white liberals being racist. The comments also share personal experiences of racism from different communities, emphasizing that racism can come from various groups.
Haha, it's tough when you don't get into the hackathon you were hoping for. It sounds like you were trying to find your EECS boyfriend at Cal Hacks, but unfortunately didn't get in. Maybe you can try applying with your berkeley.edu email next time.
The question is about finding places in the East Bay to hang out with dogs. The answer includes suggestions such as Berkeley Animal Care Services, Ohlone Park, Willard Park, and Paws for Mental Health. All of these places offer opportunities to interact with dogs in a socially acceptable way.

The question asks about the biggest problem at UC Berkeley and suggests that it is the high number of car break-ins and robberies near campus. Comments mention various issues such as the length of the academic year, club applications, affordable housing, and overcrowded classes in EECS and CS. The sentiment across all answers is that there are several problems at UC Berkeley that need to be addressed.
I've heard that Stankova is a great lecturer and has a fair amount of work, while Serganova is known for giving out a lot of work. Stankova's grading breakdown is something like 10-15% homework, 5-10% lecture attendance, 10% quizzes, and the rest split between the final and 2 midterms.

Same here, I'm struggling with my EECS126 coursework and feeling overwhelmed by the stress. It seems like a lot of people are going through the same thing, but we just have to keep pushing through and doing our best. Maybe the upcoming break will give us a chance to recharge and feel better.
Calm down, it's probably just the furry club trying to recruit new members. Don't worry, you're not late for class yet.

If you're considering taking CS 189, it's important to note that it has prerequisites such as Math 53 and a solid understanding of linear algebra. While some suggest taking a refresher course like CS 127 first, others recommend going through a ~50 page math review on the course website and taking the class if you're truly interested. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether you're confident enough in your knowledge to take the class.
The question asks for the names of professors in the BAIR lab at Berkeley who do medical imaging research.

The overall sentiment is one of skepticism and frustration towards LinkedIn influencers and their automated responses.
The question is about balancing gym and school. The answer suggests that going to the gym can actually help with academics, and it's important to focus on intensity rather than duration. It's also recommended to check the gym schedule for less busy hours.
It seems like a lot of effort, but keep applying and don't give up hope. It's possible to get an internship even if you didn't get one during peak recruiting time. There are still plenty of opportunities available, and you can set alerts for new job postings on LinkedIn to stay on top of them. It's also important to not burn yourself out and to take care of yourself while you're job searching.
Squirrelyhole stank is bothering the whole tree, including Third. They tried being polite but direct, but it didn't work. Maybe it's time to set rules and enforce them.

The question is about the etiquette of emailing a professor for permission to add a class. The general consensus is to keep the email casual but polite, and to explain why you need their permission. It's also important to be clear about the class and your status as a student. The professor may pass the email onto the lead GSI.
It seems like the psych department at this school offers mostly 3 unit classes, which is causing frustration for some psych majors who want to balance their course load and extra curriculars. Some suggestions include taking 4 classes instead of 3, finding classes in other departments, or taking gen eds and electives every semester instead of all at once.

The poster is a recent Berkeley grad who misses the bookstores in Berkeley and is looking for someone to mail them bookmarks from Moe's and Pegasus. A kind user has offered to help by sending a private message.
This is a common question among freshmen. The consensus is that the courseload is doable, but requires staying on top of all the tech classes, especially EECS 16A and CS 61B. Some students have managed to balance outside commitments like the gym and clubs, but it may require sacrificing some hours. It is recommended to assess your grasp of the content and adjust accordingly.
The question asks for the approximate cut off for an A- or an A in phys 8a, given the midterm statistics of Min/Max: 6/97, Mean/Median: 56.44/58.5, and StDev: 20.74. According to the comments, the professor calculates the final grade using a curve, and the average of the class is curved to a B. One commenter calculated that 70% would be the approximate cutoff for an A-, but this is not confirmed by the professor. Another commenter stated that the number of A's given is not consistent and there is no way to know what is needed for an A.
The helicopters circling are likely from KTVU and KPIX news, covering Berkeley's new space center announcement. The protest on campus is also being covered, but it's unlikely to be the main focus of the helicopters' attention.
Off-campus housing is generally cheaper than on-campus housing, but it depends on the size of the space you're willing to live in. You should start looking for a lease a few months before the next academic year, and apartments are usually more affordable than houses. Co-ops are also a good option to consider.
The post compares the author's visit to UC Berkeley and UCLA, noting differences in campus aesthetics, student behavior, and school spirit.

The Squirrellympics was a legendary event where red and grey squirrels came together in the University of Nutty Berkeley to celebrate life with laughter and unity, leaving a lasting memory for generations to come. The event included building a squirrel pyramid and a squirrel rocket race, but ultimately, the real victory was the joy of living in the moment.
The post is a complaint about the repetitive nature of recent Nutpastas, and the lack of original content from the squirrels on this subreddit. Some users express agreement, while others engage in name-calling and shitposting.
I agree with the sentiment that the copypastas are getting old. The first comment references the "How to avoid telling people my major (computer science)" copypasta, the second comment references the "Is this place safe?" copypasta, and the third comment agrees with the sentiment. The fourth comment is a non sequitur.
Nah, it's probably not gonna happen. The stadium's gonna be empty and you might as well just do what you want.
Thanks for the advice! I'm curious, what kind of suits are popular among Berkeley students for club interviews? Are there any specific styles or brands that are recommended?
The schedule of Data 100 + Data 140 + CS 61B + Stat 33B seems challenging but doable depending on prior experience, with some feeling overwhelmed but others handling it well.
I think it depends on the person and their cultural background. Some people's parents, like the original poster's mom, may care about their partner's major and potential earning potential, while others may not care as much. It's also important to consider that some people may prioritize different things in a partner, such as their personality and values, over their potential income.
I think it depends on your priorities and what you want to get out of the class. If you're looking to satisfy the history breadth requirement and get a DS minor, then taking Data100 and Data104 might be a good option. However, if you're looking for a more practical class that will help you in industry, Data8 might be a better choice since it uses numpy and pandas, which are commonly used in data science. It's also worth noting that Data100 doesn't require Data8 as a prerequisite, so you could potentially take it without taking Data8 first.
Based on the information provided, it seems that the consequences of not passing a class that is not a major requirement and not applicable to grad school plans may not be significant. It is recommended to plan ahead for future scheduling and requirements to ensure on-time graduation.
I agree, the fog is lovely this morning. It's a great day for a drive up to Grizzly Peak or MSRI. And who knows, maybe we'll even see Karl the Fog along the way.

I feel you guys, CS 189 is no joke. Midterms were tough, and time management was a struggle for many. Hopefully, the next drop will be more manageable!
The 189 exam administered in Berkeley CS history was reportedly one of the worst and most difficult, with students feeling unprepared and frustrated by the content and time constraints.
Average sentiment across the comments suggests that people are discussing their performance in CS70, a class on data science. One person mentions being -0.7 standard deviations away from the average American diet, while another mentions being in the top bin. Someone also asks how to calculate the standard deviation.

If you're facing sexual harassment, consider reaching out to Path to CARE or Office of the Student Advocate for support. They can help you navigate the university's processes and provide a safe space to talk about your experience.
It seems that it's possible for veterans to get into UC Berkeley as freshmen without starting at a CC first. While some veterans may have had previous college experience or used specific resources such as the Learning Resource Center, others were able to apply as freshmen and highlight their military experience in their essays. It's recommended to apply and potentially use VR&E benefits to extend the lifetime of post-9/11 or Montgomery benefits.
The postgrads in the thread discuss their job hunt experiences, with some sharing their own struggles and advice. One alum from the class of 2018, who majored in applied math, shares their journey from graduation to finding a fully remote job as a salesforce developer for a wealth management firm. They emphasize the importance of networking, learning new skills, and not being afraid to take any job to gain experience and structure. Another postgrad shares their experience of being unemployed for several months after graduation and how they found small part-time jobs in their field to help with their job search.
I think it's fair to say that Harvard's grade inflation is a topic of concern for many students, especially when compared to other schools like Berkeley. While some may argue that grade inflation is a problem in the Ivy League, others are more focused on their own personal experiences and grades. Overall, it seems like the issue of grade inflation is a complex one that may not have a simple solution.

Squirrelly flirtation: Is it real or just a nutty dream?
The question is about how to become more social. The first comment suggests accepting that first social interactions will be stunted and embarrassing and learning through trial and error. The second comment suggests starting with saying "hi" and responding to what the other person says. The third comment suggests practicing to improve. The fourth comment suggests finding a way to loosen up, such as having a drink, and finding extroverted people to hang out with. The fifth comment suggests having a drink before trying to socialize. The average sentiment is that it's important to practice and be patient with oneself, and that finding a way to loosen up may be helpful.
The original poster asked about auditing a language course and was informed that auditing is not allowed for Korean or Japanese courses at the moment. For French, they were advised to contact the department heads or a professor for more information.
It seems like the main issue here is a lack of social interaction due to being a commuter student. Some suggestions include setting up study sessions with in-class friends, joining clubs with daytime activities, and being persistent in reaching out to people for hangouts. It might also be helpful to try hanging out in student affinity spaces.
Cal Dining can be contacted through their website or by calling the campus sanitarian. The dining hall where the incident occurred was not specified. Someone else also reported mild food poisoning from Cafe 3. It's important to report incidents like this so that the department can take necessary actions to prevent further occurrences.
The recent graduate expressed frustration with the constant fundraising mail from Cal, with some fellow alumni agreeing and suggesting to call Cal UDAR to be removed from the mailing list.

However, one person said it was better than expected. Overall, it seems like the course was neither particularly easy nor particularly difficult.
Yes, some people at Berkeley do smell. It's not limited to CS majors and certain rooms like Dwinelle 145 and 155 can exacerbate the smell. It's not very common, but it does happen.

Absolutely. It's time for the ASUC to be transparent about their funding of RSOs like BFP. We need to know how our money is being used and who we're supporting.
Thanks for sharing the good luck message and the form link, <human>. The form is aimed at understanding the experience of students with chronic illnesses and creating change on campus.
The bestie is visiting Berkeley and wants to know what to do. Some suggestions include the botanical gardens, Indian Rock, BAMFA, café crawl, ferry to SF, and Albany Bulb hike. UCB students get free admission to the botanical gardens, and the ferry from Jack London to SF ferry building is recommended.
Average sentiment from the comments is that the MCQ section of the Econ 100B midterm was challenging due to time restrictions, but there is hope for the free response section to save their grades.
It seems like you're all feeling the same way after your first econ exam. It's normal to feel scared and question your abilities, but don't give up just yet! With some hard work and determination, you can turn things around. Remember that you have three late drops throughout your time at Berkeley, so don't rush into anything just yet. Keep that last day to drop in your calendar and see if you can improve your performance in the next exams.
The midterm was difficult, with a lot of calculations and no practice problems similar to it. Many students are hoping for a curve, including those who dislike the professor Shawn Chi.
The econ 100b midterm was a tough one, with many students feeling unprepared and overwhelmed. Some even compared it to their data 102 midterm, which was also challenging. However, it seems like the econ 100a midterm was just as bad, so at least there's some consolation in that.

The question is about finding a cheap 13-inch laptop for coding and portability with good battery life. One answer suggests the Thinkpad t480, while another recommends applying for a free long-term loaner laptop through the Student Technology Equity Program (STEP) which may have Thinkpads, Thinkbooks, and Apple MacBook Air 13 available. The application period for Fall closes on 11/26.
It seems like the drivers in the area are not paying enough attention to the road, and this has led to some close calls for cyclists. The police have been getting pushback from the local "activist class", which has resulted in a decrease in traffic enforcement. The solution may be to call the police when there are specific complaints, but it's unclear if this will be effective without more consistent enforcement.
It seems that the importance of GPA in finding a job varies greatly depending on the field and the specific job. While some jobs, like those in quant trading, may require a high GPA, others may not consider it at all. It's important to research the specific job and company to determine the importance of GPA. Additionally, it's worth noting that other factors, such as personal projects and internships, can also play a role in securing a job.
The original poster is feeling lost and unsure about their future after graduating from Cal and losing a close family member. Commenters suggest focusing on self-care, setting goals, and exploring different opportunities for personal and professional growth.
I'm with you guys, let's crush this midterm together! Remember, it's not over until it's Rao-over. And even if things don't go as planned, there's always the clobber for the final. Plus, don't forget that your self worth isn't determined by your grades. Let's all stay positive and support each other. Go Bearsssss!
Hug is on sabbatical and won't be teaching 61b this semester. Justin Yokota is taking over his lectures. Denero is also taking a break and will return to teach a smaller cohort in the future. Hug may have gone on sabbatical due to negotiation drama last year.
Taking a break from school can be a good option to improve mental health. It's important to talk to advisors and consider a reduced course load or easier classes. Medication and therapy may also be helpful.
4th comment: The Cal community explores the intricate dance of life's constants and variables at UC Berkeley, where the interplay of mathematical concepts and quantum entanglements shape our unique narratives. From the RSF gym to the botanical garden, students engage in a multi-variable wavefunction of experiences, much like Physics 137A, where the uncertainty principle of life's direction and the entanglement of all life on Earth are intertwined.
Around 40 minutes into the hour, most people go to their next class, so seats may open up at Main Stacks. Other libraries on campus, like Bioscience at VLSB and Engineering, may also have available seats after 5 pm. On weekends, try going when they first open at 1 pm.

A man's hygiene is a concern for his partner, who wants him to smell unique and not like other men. The partner also wants him to wash his hands and not use Leetcode premium.
Pho at Foothill is decent, but not the best in Berkeley. It's better than what was served last time, but still not as good as Wat Mongkolratanaram's brunch or Pho Le. Endless refills are available.
The post is asking about the status of Wat Mongkolratanaram's Sunday food service. The comment provides a promo code for Duffl.
The user is looking for a good place to get chicken/vegetable soup for their sick roommates. They preferably want a place near Unit 3. The comments suggest using New Duffl for food delivery and using the promo code GO1 for $5 off. The user expresses gratitude for the suggestions.
The question is about a Duffl promo code for $5 off. The answer is that the promo code is GO1.

I'm glad to hear that there are many transfers at Berkeley and that you've had a positive experience adjusting to the school. It's great to hear that there are resources like the transfer center to help with the transition and that there are many opportunities to get involved on campus. It's also good to know that while there may be some challenges with academics and stigmatizing attitudes towards transfers, there are many more positive experiences to be had at Berkeley.
It seems like the person is a sophomore who got rejected from a tech club and is wondering if they'll have another chance to join as a junior. The other comments don't seem to offer much support or advice.
Math 54 is cancelled, due to the professors being flaky and everything popping up. Norman Sheu is the hero who saved the day.
The question is about whether to take Math 56 after taking Math 54 and whether it is a better use of time to take Data 100 instead of Math 56. The general consensus is that if you are taking Math 54, it is not necessary to take Math 56 next semester, as it is more difficult conceptually and workload-wise. However, if you have already taken Math 54, it is fine to take Math 56 and Data 100 together, and it will not be a problem workload-wise.
The identity of Oski is a mystery to many, but it seems that Carol is the one who wears the suit and roams around. The Oski Committee also plays a role in the Oski experience, with handlers making sure he doesn't get into too much trouble.

Yeah, I heard that Charisma and Connection Decal is a great class to take. It's definitely worth it for the valuable skills and growth you'll get from it. Plus, you can make friends in the class, even if it's virtual.
Sure, I can share the reader with you all. Just let me know if you need any specific sections or chapters.

The question is about clubs and their requirements. The answer mentions that the club doesn't have any training for new members without CS project experience, but they have a minimum requirement of having taken or being currently enrolled in 61A/equivalent or having previous coding experience. Another answer suggests that HoneyBee's ad group on campus is still accepting applications and it's a good option for those who are beginners or seasoned.
Sure, I'd be happy to help! It looks like you're trying to extend the deadline for the Open Project application, which is due in 2 days (Wednesday, February 1st). Unfortunately, the original post didn't mention anything about extending the deadline, but you can definitely reach out to the team and ask if it's possible. Good luck!
Yeah, it seems like the clubs aren't really doing anything groundbreaking and the recommendations they provide aren't always taken into account. It's also mentioned that working with local businesses could have a bigger impact. Additionally, it seems like having connections and friends can be helpful in getting ahead. Overall, the sentiment is that the clubs aren't necessarily necessary for success and there are other things that students would rather do with their time.
It seems like the person is waiting for an official offer for a PhD program, but was told by a current PhD student that an invitation for an interview means they are admitted.

It seems that the author of the post had a negative experience with the "pho bar" at CalDining, which was supposed to celebrate diversity and inclusion. The author suggests several improvements, including cooking the noodles thoroughly, serving the broth at a higher temperature, providing chopsticks, having servers serve the phở, adding more seasoning to the broth, and providing a brief history and overview of phở. Some commenters suggest that the author should have lower expectations for dining hall food, while others agree with the suggestions and express concern about the negative impact on the representation of Vietnamese culture.
The reason why Clark Kerr food is perceived to be better than Croads or Cafe 3 could be due to the unique history and architecture of the dining hall, the preferences of the student population, and the individual chef teams at each dining hall. Additionally, the lower crowd volume at Clark Kerr may contribute to better food quality.

Hey, just wanted to say that it's great to see that we're all struggling with the same thing. I have a morning class and it's so hard to get out of bed, but I've found that if I plan ahead and set reminders, it helps a lot. Also, having a friend to meet up with before class is a good idea. And discipline is key, even if we don't feel like doing it, we just have to push through and get it done. Thanks for sharing your experiences!
I don't think this is a good idea, focus on yourself.

It seems like some people on campus are being approached by strangers asking for directions and then asking for personal information such as phone numbers or social media accounts. Some people suggest reporting the incidents to UCPD and being cautious when approached by strangers. Others have had similar experiences with people asking about church or bible study groups. It's important to stay safe and aware of your surroundings.
Yeah, it seems like you got caught using Chegg during an exam. It's not looking good, but it might not be the end of the world. You should talk to a caseworker at the Student Advocate's Office and go to any CSC meetings with them. They can help you figure out what to do next.

Some commenters share their personal experiences in both fields, highlighting the challenges and rewards of each path.
Hey! It looks like the original poster is considering withdrawing from Berkeley due to a recent assault.

Thanks for the detailed responses! It seems like the general consensus is that 3 months may not be enough time to build a strong application, especially since I won't have enough academic credits to transfer until spring of 2024.

Hi! I'm also a big fan of Beach House and I agree that they're underrated. I haven't heard of Suicide before, but I'll definitely check them out. It's great to meet other fans of the band, especially since they're not as well-known as some other artists.
I chose Berkeley because of its prestige and the amazing civil engineering program, and I'm not alone in that sentiment. Many of us here found the campus to be the right fit for us, whether it was due to the campus vibe or the opportunities it provided.
The boy whistling in Moffitt is getting some side-eye from people, but they're not saying anything to his face. Someone suggested complaining on Reddit, but others think that's not enough.

Yeah, it seems like most people agree that going to office hours is a great way to improve your understanding of the material, and that it's important to be prepared with questions beforehand. Some people suggest using office hours as a way to start a conversation and build rapport with the professor or GSI, while others recommend being more direct and asking specific questions about the course material.

The idea of closing the campus to the public has been met with mixed feelings. While some believe it would increase security, others argue that it would be inconvenient and expensive. The university is a public space, and closing it would limit access to various facilities and events. Additionally, it could lead to profiling and discrimination. Overall, the sentiment is that closing the campus would not be a practical solution to safety concerns.
I think the main issue here is that some students feel that professors are prioritizing their own egos over their students' needs. Some students have expressed that they would prefer to have the option to attend class remotely, but some professors are insisting on in-person attendance. It's possible that some professors believe that students learn better in in-person classes, but it's also possible that they are prioritizing their own preferences over their students' needs. It's important for professors to consider their students' needs and preferences when deciding how to conduct their classes.

The class has been divided into two independent sections, Lecture 001 and Lecture 002, with different instructors. The original instructor, Dr. Talaska, has been removed as instructor without their consent and without consultation, according to a recent update on the class's Ed forum. The Math Department has assured students that the class will still satisfy all university requirements and count towards pre-reqs, majors, etc., but the structure of the class has been adjusted due to the late start.

The class format of Math54, which relies on inquiry-based learning, has been criticized for its lack of structure and resources, poorly written prework assignments, and inaccessibility, particularly for students with ADD or heavy workloads. The class is based on completing checkboxes through at-home "skill quizzes," group work, and prework before each lecture and section, with no official resources such as a textbook or lectures to watch. Students have also expressed frustration with the lack of flexibility and prescriptive format, which requires 6 hours of mandatory class attendance divided into 3 lectures and 3 sections for Tallaska's portion of the class, accompanied by prework assignments that are supposed to prepare them for group work.
You can apply to one major in the College of Letters and Science as a transfer student at UC Berkeley. While it is not possible to select a secondary major, it is easy to switch majors within the college once you start in the fall as long as you meet the major prerequisites.
Casual!

Some comments suggest that taking CS61c without CS670 might be possible, while others recommend taking CS61b as a pre-req. The user is also considering taking a 2-unit class that sounds interesting to maintain financial aid.

It seems that the experiences at Berkeley may vary, but it is important to take precautions and use common sense when walking around the city, especially at night. While some areas may be quieter than others, it is still a city with a homeless population, and encounters may happen. It is also important to note that the campus itself is generally safe, but the surrounding areas may have different levels of safety.
Agreed, waiting around 10 minutes is a good compromise. It's understandable to want to take out your clothes as soon as possible, but it's also important to respect other people's belongings. It's not uncommon for people to forget their laundry or have inconsistent timing, so it's best to err on the side of caution and wait a bit before taking out someone else's clothes.
The weeder HW is challenging, but it's designed to prepare students for the rest of the commission. It's the hardest HW, but everything after that is much easier.
Hey there! It looks like someone is looking for a good website to get a fake ID from. One person mentioned needing a fake ID for tax fraud, but another pointed out that they are not 21 yet. It seems like a cop might be involved in the conversation, but the original poster claims to be a 19-year-old.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you're asking. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?
The question asks about a torrenting site called dTella that was popular at Berkeley in 2009, and if it still exists. The answer mentions that it was replaced by DC++ and that it is no longer maintained. Another answer mentions using DC++ and dTella to download Game of Thrones episodes and textbooks, and using openwrt routers to provide wifi access to the software. Another comment mentions the Putnam porno being filmed in Unit 1, not Unit 3.
The original poster asked how badly they would need to do on exams to fail CS61A, to which one commenter replied that they would need to score around 35 points between the first two midterms and not take the final to fail the course, while another commenter noted that the second midterm will be harder due to the introduction of recursion. A third commenter pointed out that the 90% statistic may be misleading due to students dropping the course after the first midterm. The fourth commenter expressed relief at the information provided.
The post is about a group of people planning to sign a lease for a 2 bedroom apartment in the Sterling Berkeley Collection in Allston. They are concerned about the place since they can't get a tour and are looking for any red flags.

The question asks about the Engineering Math & Stats major and what it's like, what kind of jobs and pay you can expect, and how mathy it gets in 3rd and 4th year. It's mentioned that some students switch into the major from L&S, and that it's rare to switch from L&S into CoE. The second comment suggests talking to an advisor for more information on GPA and application requirements.
No, I did not end up switching. The main difference between pursuing an applied math degree versus an Engineering Math & Statistics in CoE is that the latter is more focused on practical applications and may offer more job opportunities in engineering fields. However, both degrees can lead to a variety of job options, and the choice ultimately depends on personal interests and career goals.
Mentioned places are Shef, Viks Chaat, Momo Masalas and Ghar Jao. All are good options for non-veg food in Berkeley.

It's recommended to check Fandango for movie times and ticket availability, or call the theater for more information. The theater is still using traditional ticketing methods, either through online purchases or at the concession stand.
If you're planning on taking summer classes, it's worth checking out the financial aid calculator on CalCentral to see how much you might be responsible for paying. Some people have reported paying less per month during the summer than during the semester, and one person mentioned getting reimbursed for some of their costs. It's also worth noting that some classes, like Physics 8B, may be offered during the summer.

The question of whether or not a specific code is allowed in a course is discussed, with one comment mentioning that it is technically in scope but unlikely to be allowed due to concerns about cheating. Another comment mentions that the course is difficult to fail, while a third comment notes that no one can or is allowed to answer the question. The fourth comment suggests that one should expect the unexpected.
The question is about what to write on a cheat sheet for CS61A midterm. The answer suggests writing down common mistakes from practice exams and general steps/things to look out for on certain problems.

Practice exams are the best way to prepare for exams, according to the user. They suggest focusing on practice exams to improve performance.
It seems that Wehrheim, a math professor at Berkeley, has released a manifesto detailing her side of the story regarding the controversy surrounding her Math 54 class. The students who signed the petition to remove her from teaching the class claim that they want to learn, but some believe that they are only doing it for the easy grade. The class format that Wehrheim implemented has already been tested and found to be unsuccessful, as it left students underprepared for future classes. The university stepped in and stopped the class mid-semester, which some believe is not acceptable.
Me too, just for research purposes 😉
Hey there! It seems like there's a lot of concern about mental health in the Berkeley community. One person mentioned feeling depressed and suicidal, while another shared their own experience with depression and anxiety. It's important to remember that there's no shame in seeking help, and there are resources available on campus such as the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). If you're struggling, don't hesitate to reach out for support.
The original poster is concerned about a person who sounds like the Joker laughing loudly outside their apartment at night.

The landlord has responded that they will look into the non-emergency number and that they are aware of the situation.
I feel like I'm not the only one who doesn't care much about grades at Berkeley, but still tries to do well in my classes. It's important to remember that there's more to life than just grades, and as long as we do our best, we'll be fine.
I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide a summary for this comment thread as it does not contain a question or answer.
The data science major is popular among students who don't meet the GPA requirements for computer science. It's a versatile major that covers a wide range of topics, including programming languages like Python and R, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Overall, students seem to have a positive view of the major, citing its practical applications and job prospects as reasons for their satisfaction.
It seems like you're considering joining a club for social reasons, even if the major/field of study isn't your interest. While there's some hesitation, the general sentiment is to trust your gut and communicate with the club if you decide to join.
The movie "Beautiful Disaster" centers around a college student named Travis Maddox who fights in underground boxing matches and charms college girls. He makes a bet with a freshman girl that if he loses his next fight, he must remain sex-free for a month, and if he wins, she must live in his apartment for the same amount of time. The movie seems to take place in a fictional college, not Berkeley.
My suite managed to get it working after connecting the PS5 via ethernet. Why? I have absolutely no idea. It seems like the PS5 has issues connecting to certain enterprise Wi-Fi networks with QuietIE enabled. Ask your IT department to roll out Mist APs instead. No problems there.
The likelihood of getting a single in UC Berkeley apartments is low, with over-enrollment being the reason for the struggle. It is advised to put "any housing" as the 5th preference to increase the chance of getting on-campus housing.

Here's a sneak peek of /r/BrandNewSentence using the top posts of the year! The top post is about someone named rawdogged who had a unique experience on a flight. The second post is about mental illness, and the third post is about vegan hunting. The sentiment across all answers is neutral.
Steve Huffman, Reddit CEO, was on campus today and spoke in UGBA 194 this afternoon.
The color of Evans Hall is a subject of debate, with some saying it's green and others claiming it's gray. It was originally gray but was repainted to a greenish-gray shade.
The original poster is looking for a 1BR/studio apartment in Berkeley for the lease starting in May/June. They have been having trouble finding one on websites like CL and FB. Commenters provided a list of websites where they found their apartments in Berkeley, including North Berkeley Properties, Cedar Properties, Lapham, and more. One commenter mentioned that they have had a positive experience with North Berkeley Properties. Another commenter mentioned that the process is the same for fall 2023 as it was for fall 2022, and that haggling the price down a bit will help.
Another user recommended East Bay Vivarium for reptile vet services in the area. It's worth a try!
The student is struggling with a proof and asked for help on Reddit. The proof is a simple epsilon-delta proof explained nicely with LaTeX. The student should use LaTeX to make it easier to read. The GSI's explanation is appreciated and the student should not be afraid to ask questions.
Another recommendation for hairdressers who specialize in cutting curly hair is Theresa from Anton Salon on College. Thanks for sharing your suggestions!
The original poster is struggling with declaring a major at Berkeley and is considering Data Science or Applied Math. They have experience in coding and have taken some lower-division CS courses but are struggling with them. They are interested in the idea of AI/ML but haven't taken CS 188, CS 189. They are considering taking more relevant upper-div CS courses and are interested in the career prospects of Data Science. They have seen Data Scientists at big companies with majors in Statistics, Math, Physics, CS, and various disciplines of engineering. They are also considering Applied Math with a concentration in CS. They are unsure about the best major for grad school and working as a data scientist in the tech industry or in research. They have room/time to choose 3 CS courses and 3 anything else courses (upper-div).
Average sentiment across comments is neutral.
Agreed, commuting is tough. Wish there was a center for commuters to study, eat, and relax. Classes with late OH/review sessions and partners with bad schedules make it even harder. Hopefully, the discord link helps.
The original poster asked about the Berkeley School Psychology Program and the experience of black grad students at Berkeley. One comment suggested contacting the grad coordinator to speak with current students in the program. Another comment thanked the original poster for the congratulations.
The class average on MT1 was higher than expected, but it's unclear if MT2 and the Final will be made harder than usual. The class has double clobber, so midterms don't matter as long as you do well on the final. Getting full credit on hw/proj/labs and 85% on the final is likely enough for an A.
I don't care about your opinion on Funko Pops. Your comment is irrelevant to me.
The sentiment among the comments is that Bio 1A at Berkeley is a poorly managed course with confusing and sometimes contradictory answers from instructors and TAs, few practice materials, and a heavy emphasis on memorization over problem-solving. The course is seen as a weeder course, rushing through key fundamentals and testing on minute details. The GSIs are seen as trying their best, but the course structure and lack of guidance from instructors make it difficult for students to fully grasp the material. The lab class is seen as well done, but the regular class is seen as a source of frustration and stress.
Happy Valentine's Day! The post author is feeling down about being single, but friends are offering support and reminding them to enjoy the single life. One friend even shared a link to a past solo soiree event at Berkeley.
I'm going to the SIK-K concert with my bf! Wish I could go too. No one in my friend group is interested in going.

It is also suggested that the poster should start the recruiting process in August and be prepared for the possibility of not receiving a return offer.
"Yeah, it's annoying but it resets every few days. I remember when it was supposed to be once a month but it reset way more often than that."
The student's residency appeal was denied. They were told to provide as much evidence as possible to prove residency. The Student Advocate's Office offers one-on-one assistance with financial aid caseworkers trained in dealing with similar issues.
The Standard at Berkeley, managed by Landmark Properties, has been accused of using a faulty lease that causes financial harm to tenants, manipulates utility billing, and double-charges for months. The building has also experienced flooding and construction issues. The city and landlord have been in discussions about the legality of the lease, and the building has had a history of safety incidents, including a balcony collapse in 2015.
Just be confident and find hobbies or interests to be comfortable in your own skin. Joining a gym or rock climbing group can help.

Added you back! I'm Carrru, nice to meet you.
The OP describes their struggles with their college roommates, who they have known for years but feel like they don't reciprocate their efforts in maintaining the friendship. They initiate most activities and feel like their introverted roommate would rather spend time on their phone than hang out with them. The comments suggest that sometimes friends grow apart and it's okay to branch out and find new friends, and that living with friends can be challenging, especially if their social wants/needs don't align.
It seems like the original question was about the possibility of getting an A in 61B after getting a B in 61A. Some people think it's difficult but not impossible, while others believe it's definitely possible with hard work. It was also mentioned that 61B is more project-focused than exam-based. Some tips for success were given, such as utilizing office hours and starting exam preparation early. Finally, someone asked for advice on 61B.
Yeah, it seems like most people are having a hard time finding housing in Berkeley for the 2023-2024 school year.

It seems like most property managers are telling people to come back later in the year.
The question is about the difficulty of getting internships and the possibility of using Ripplematch to improve the chances of landing one. The answer suggests using Ripplematch, a platform specifically designed for college students, which provides curated job opportunities and a higher chance of landing interviews compared to traditional job boards. It also recommends signing up by March 15th to increase the chances of success in the summer recruiting season.
The question is about dropping a minor during the last semester. The answer is that it is possible to drop a minor during the last semester, but it depends on the specific university and major. Some universities allow students to drop their minor during the last semester, while others require it to be completed. It's best to check with the academic advisor or the university's website for more information.
You're welcome! It seems like you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed by the projects and struggling on the first midterm. But don't worry, the clobber policy is a great way to make up for a bad midterm grade, and there are plenty of resources available to help you improve, like attending CSM section/exam preps and Bridge sessions, and dedicating enough time to study for the next midterm and final. Good luck!
It seems like you're all going through tough times, whether it's dealing with the pain of a past relationship or struggling to find a meaningful connection. Keep pushing through and remember that healing takes time, but love can still be found in the future.

The RSF has a variety of machines and equipment that can help you build strength and muscle, but it's important to start with exercises that you're comfortable with and that you can do correctly. Additionally, engaging your core and the right muscles is important for overall strength and stability.

I'm not sure if you're asking about the time it takes to get to Marin from Berkeley or the sentiment towards Berkeley as a school, but it seems like the consensus is that it takes around an hour and 20 minutes to get to Tennessee Beach on a Saturday around noon, and that Berkeley can be a bit of a nightmare for some students.

The sentiment is generally positive, with some commenters noting that the double major is doable and can provide some benefits, but not necessarily necessary for career goals.
Ahh that makes sense. I remember it being near/at Crave Subs so that adds up. It seems like it was a self-serve boba machine concept that was proposed to the market, but was later shut down.
Hey there! It sounds like a lot of people are struggling with feeling out of place at Cal. It's totally normal to feel that way as a transfer student, but remember that you're here for a reason and you've made a big investment in your education. Try not to compare yourself to others and focus on your own progress. It's also okay to take things at your own pace and not rush into things like clubs or social events. Remember that it's all about finding what works for you and making the most of your time at Cal.

It seems like a lot of people are struggling with loneliness and making friends at UC Berkeley, even if they have a lot of acquaintances. Some people feel like they don't know what to say during conversations and don't have friends outside of club meetings and get togethers. Others feel like they have no friends at all, and spend their birthdays alone. However, there are also people who are down to be friends and want to hang out.
Hey there! It looks like you're going through a tough time with friendships, but remember that your worth isn't determined by the number of friends you have.

The post discusses the possibility of attending office hours for a CS class at UC Berkeley as a community college student. It is mentioned that the CS department at Berkeley uses an online queue system that requires a Berkeley account, making it difficult for community college students to attend in-person office hours.

It seems that upper-division CS classes are generally perceived to be lighter in workload compared to lower-division classes, but this is not necessarily indicative of them being conceptually easier.

The economy is returning to normal, but what does that mean exactly? The tech bubble in the 2000s was proof that there are a finite number of positions in tech, and something similar is happening now.

The question is whether Berkeley's CS61A course should start with functional programming and if Stat 20 should teach Tidyverse instead of base R. Some argue that it's good to introduce the basics of functional programming early in the semester, while others believe that it's not necessary to focus solely on Tidyverse. The course does already incorporate some functional programming aspects, and other courses like Stat 133 and Stat 153 continue to teach R. It's also worth noting that some DS courses use Python instead of R or base R.

The question is about a documentary being made by a UC Berkeley graduate journalism student named Grace about how introductory STEM courses weed out underrepresented minorities at a higher rate. Some comments suggest that the focus should be on why underrepresented minorities struggle in these courses, rather than blaming the system, and that cultural differences in prioritizing education and disparities between high schools in different socioeconomic communities may play a role. One commenter suggests looking into the dialogue around the LSAT as an analogous case. Another commenter mentions that they have dropped out of life.
The question is about the difficulty of LinkedIn's Python skill assessment quiz and whether passing CS61A is enough to pass it.

One student recommended taking CS10 as a way to ease into CS at Berkeley.
