Those are two of perhaps the five most successful programs of all time, joining the most successful conference. The closest rival in terms of revenue/success is the Big 10 (which then had 14 teams, long story), and this made them conclude that they needed to expand to remain competitive and command a larger media contract. Los Angeles is the second largest media market in the country and USC is one of the most successful football programs so the B1G was happy to grab them, and grabbing UCLA to preserve their rivalry and corner the LA market made sense. So they added them in June 2022.\n\nThis put the PAC-10 in a difficult position. They had lost their biggest brand and biggest media market right in the midst of contract negotiations, and had some teams that could conceivably join other conferences. Furthermore, with media companies beginning to tighten their belts, the prospect of finding a media deal that could satisfy all ten schools was daunting. Negotiations continued for about a year, when this past July CU Boulder got sick of waiting and left for the Big 12. After that, things moved quickly. The remaining 9 teams essentially told the conference to show what they had in terms of a media deal ASAP. What emerged was an all-streaming deal with Apple TV which was both so-so on the revenue and visibility, which is desirable both to give easy access to fans and potential recruits. Oregon and Washington were the two best brands left in the conference, and after that they left for a half share of revenue from the B1G. Left with the prospect of being stuck on a sinking ship, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah all left for the Big 12 within hours, leaving the PAC with four teams. \n\nOf course, Cal and Stanford were seemingly caught flat footed by all of this. What emerged were several weeks of negotiations with the ACC to join on a partial share (alongside with SMU, who was not in the PAC-12 but has very wealthy donors willing to subsidize the school to play for *free* in a superior conference to the one they are currently in). So, starting next fall the trio will be ACC bound. This leaves the PAC-12 with **two** schools for next year, Oregon State and Washington State. Sorry guys.\n\nThe remaining four power conferences could be described as follows:\n\n\n1. Southeastern Conference- the most successful in football (which is the money maker for all college sports) with die hard fans because football is a religion in the South.\n\n\n2. Big Ten (18) - predominantly midwestern but now with a few west coast/eastern seaboard teams. These are generally flagship land grant universities with a few elite private schools like Northwestern and USC, and the schools generally have large fanbases though not as much success as the ACC.\n\n\n3. Atlantic Coast Conference - probably the most \"academic\" of the remaining power 4. Has schools like Cal/Stanford, Duke, North Carolina, Virginia, etc with a few good football powers in Florida State and Clemson. A far step below the top two from the revenue perspective, but has some decent teams and great success in basketball, women's soccer, Olympic sports, etc.\n\n\n4.

Furthermore, I believe those same studies show that the benefit does not exist when taking notes by computer.\n\nMost of my courses were math/physics with many equations, so I also think taking notes by hand was probably easier than trying to type.

I was at Berkeley for 5 years and I can't immeditely recall having a black professor or even a black (u)GSI. Mixed-race Hispanic, east Asian, south Asian, Arab, plain white, all yes, but not black. And when you have a campus that is pretty cliquey to begin with (although I'm not sure other campuses are much different), it leaves the people in the smallest groups feeling isolated.\n\nDunno what the solution is. Affirmative action is not it, plus it hasn't been legal for UCs for decades anyway. Probably the state of California needs to make more resources available for the schools and school districts in primarily-black communities such that more qualified applicants are coming from those schools.", "id": "jypy67j", "link_id": "t3_167gmkt", "upvote_count": 17}, {"body": "As an indigenous student I found community in programs like the NASD and INC, both indigenous student groups.

People have given commiseration, resources, and moral support. I genuinely Dig all that.\n\nBut as a white guy, I'm going to be the bad cop for a minute. I'll be the redditor you talked about in your post, and I'm going to go a little harder.\n\nWhenever Reddit sees these types of posts, you're right, the response is, \"Maybe you're the problem\" or \"you sound kind of insufferable\". For this one, most people won't go there because race is involved. I'm saying fuckit, that's not the issue.\n\nI don't know you, I don't even go to your school(I'm at a different T20, so similar environment), but this thought pattern isn't new to me.\n\nThe reason I even bothered to pop in here is because every feeling you described is exactly what I've experienced myself when feeling \"othered\". It's a shit feeling to say the least. Every time a classmate dismisses you, it makes you feel like a loser. Every joke feels insidious, every story feels like a one-up, and every intellectual discussion feels like it doesn't involve you. It's like you're \"that guy\" that nobody wants to fuck with because you're not part of the club.\n\nHere's the thing, and please trust me when I say this--people FEEL your energy. When you're in your head, people feel it. When you're trying to just get through class rather than enjoying it, people feel it. When you're defensive (you are absolutely defensive), people FEEL it.\n\nAnd this is where I throw your line back at you, \"Maybe you ARE the problem\". That doesn't feel good to hear, maybe you've already stopped reading. In case you haven't, Ima keep going.\n\nI know it's hard to just \"flip the switch\" and be a baller group member. The reality is though, you probably have some awesome qualities to share. Start believing that. You got into fucking Berkeley dude; that's better than I can say. Something brought you there. You're WANTED. Use that something, or maybe something else, you have value to add. At the end of the day, that's all that matters in these situations.\n\nYou can be gun toting, MAGA, and Catholic conservative in a class full of \"woke\" people. If you're out there slinging logic, humor, or good \"vibes\", people will eat it up. All of these supposed barriers vanish when you bring something to the table.\n\nAnd that's my big point here. If you add value, nobody gives as fuck about your differences. You can be the biggest dipshit in the world, but if you bring great energy to your group, people will want to be around you.\n\nLastly, You honestly sound like you're in a fucked up place. Still, please dear GOD, believe me that you have something valuable to add. This isn't something that happens overnight. People will test you, put you down, and imply you're stupid/unfunny. Fuck those people. Build on that mindset of bringing something to the table and I promise this will sort itself out. Continue to build on that, and they will love you.\n\nYou're going to be fine man.

Let me tell you why it really depends how you do, not your major.\n\nPeople say internship makes you more job opportunities. To get internship, a lot of applicants apply to one job or title. And, you might hear a story like \"I applied 1000 jobs, but didn't hear back a single one\". This kind of stories were very common last year when job market was freeze.\nHowever, there is a catch in this story. They didn't show your resume, gpa, what courses they took, and skills. Moreover, no matter how many resources you have, it was extremely hard to find 1000 jobs since the companies really didn't hire that many fresh blood.\n\nThe thing they might have said could be literally \"whatever jobs\" they saw. Then it makes sense, because if you saw linkedin job page there were over at least 1000 jobs at the list even during hiring freeze.\n\nNow, you may understand why those people couldn't land in even a single position. When you see job description, it says your possible responsibility in the workplace. In other words, that means what you will do if you join the company. But, one thing you have to know is they are companies, not school. They don't expect you know everything, but they also don't expect they should teach you from A to Z.\nThey are spending their money on you, and that's no small amount. In the shoes of employers, you are expected to contribute to the work and to be obvious to make some benefits which can offset their lots of spending.\n\nImagine you have your own cafe. People loves your tea, and more people come to your cafe. You can't afford the number of customers, so it's time to hire someone who will assist you. \nYou got two applicants. One applicant is handcraft who is really quick at making tea, but less knowledge about tea. The other applicant reads a lot of books about teas and big fan of tea, but is really suck and slow at using one's hand.\nThe point here is you need more hands, not a tea lover. You have enough knowledge about tea, and that is proved by people who loves your teas.\nIf you were the second applicant, know-tea-very-well guy, you might be disappointed. You appealed your broad knowledge about teas and passion, but rejected. The terrible part is the employer didn't tell you the reason why you get rejected. Of course, this is also true for tech job market. When you get rejected, they won't tell you the reason.\n\nI once thought job is something to be gotten by the name of school or major and something else. But, it wasn't and isn't true. Your resume will be reviewed comprehensive, and what i meant by comprehensive is \"in the shoes of employer\". The hint of what the employers' shoes look like is written on job description. Once you fully understand what the description is saying and you get the skills it's saying, then you will have some chances. Your major doesn't matter as long as you have the skills. Many people don't know this procedure, and just apply whatever they see on the page. \n\nAfter applying jobs for which you have skills, you will get an email requesting OA. OA is coding test you will take before interview. And, here many people get rejected also. Even many CS major kids also get rejected at OA. I got rejected also while my friend who is ds major passed the test. The test is easy version or hard version of leetecode.

How can we make things better?", "body": "I'm kinda hit or miss on Reddit and social media generally. I checked out the subreddit today and the many posts of people feeling excluded, withdrawing, out of place feels almost abnormal to me.\n\nA quick synopsis of myself: Mexican, neurally disabled, high school dropout and underwent the hardworking CC heuristic to elite university transfer pipeline. For the longest time, I felt alone in my tribulations of a neurodiverse/minority soul in a stereotypical world, I can say that much.\n\nI can attest to many positive aspects of Berkeley my 9 months here, one major downside is the lack of prompt administrative action to promote and foster humanistic inclusivity.\n\nSome examples include my CC periodically held events for the disability community to connect and garner that inclusive stance which otherwise would've went missing. I can apprise firsthand that sensation of belonging was pivotal in many of my friend's journeys to graduate college and achieve their dreams. The fact that DSP had nothing along those lines was a shocker to me! It didn't seem anything outside the parameters of their administrative red rape existed either. I felt indifferent to this at the time, but I empathize for the other disabled students on campus yearning for a community where they can reap benefits from a safe inclusivity that's otherwise missing.\n\nYou all have your own stories to share, that's ascertain. We can all come to the collective consensus that Berkeley (like many elite institutions) has a major dilemma with (the lack of) addressing humanistic discrepancies.\n\nSo my question is: how can we fix this, or at the very least lay the foundations for a working blueprint? I would love to hear everyone's suggestions. I'm working hard in my current field to earn money and help the people around me, so if there's something we can create that needs some funding to make it happen that Berkeley hasn't accomplished yet, I'll fund it out of pocket to make it happen. We're human and are all in this together. It pains to see this uptick in people's voices flushed out when we can spire this immense, sustainable change to begin transforming the very community we live in for the better.\n\nI'm an absolute believer of change, as someone once believing college was too large of a dream to fetch to attending college, let alone Berkeley.

I heard about their Health Engine counterpart as well and thought it might be something nice to apply into.

Now I am having second thoughts especially because of this whole disaster and literally today I heard some stories today about Phoenix's toxic culture. While I think they have cool projects and their accelerator seems interesting, overall I think this whole typeform situation just proves how unorganized and unprofessional the club is. I was looking through their previous executive boards and members and it seems a lot of the more professional older more experienced members left the club. Honestly I don't care which one is better and personally do think Phoenix is better now but the gap isn't close. The lack of effort on Phoenix's social media compared to all the other clubs was already so apparent during recruitment. It looked like they spent 5 minutes making their intro Fall recruitment post.\n\nCan you imagine all the people who applied early in the application process and don't check their social media.

This is why the \"smell of death\" is difficult to remove when something rots indoors, because it releases rancid oily vapors into the air (putrescine and cadaverine). Unlike more volatile compounds which easily diffuse and evaporate off surfaces, fat and oil are highly stable and leave residue (due to strong hydrogen bonds in the molecular structure of fat). This causes the scent TO COAT structures, skin, clothing, everything! In your case, it sounds like cooking fats/oils are responsible. \n\nThere is a solution, but it's a bit labor-intensive. Take pinesol (it has to be pinesol), double the recommended amount for diluting, then with a soft dish sponge, gently scrub ALL surfaces inside the house. The drywall, the floors, the windows, the ceiling, picture frames, the upholstery of couches and chairs etc. Everything that could potential have that oily residue from the air needs to be scrubbed with pinesol. The pinesol helps break the hydrogen bonds that make the oil so difficult to remove, and it has a veryyy strong scent that will help mask the odor. Next, launder all of your linens to get the oils out of those too. Curtains, towels, bedsheets, clothing etc. Use gain or tide, because that's the good shit.\n\nAfter that...\n\nOpen all the windows and let fresh air circulate for a couple days. Pinesol is nice, but it's vapors need to diffuse. \n\nGet a wax melter and leave that shit on 24/7. It's much safe than candles and lasts longer.\n\nUse scented lotion or perfume oil instead of alcohol-based sprays. It will last much longer. Also, apply perfume onto your shirt to make the scent last longer. \n\n\nPS, if you want to hid the smell of a dead body, do all of this too.", "id": "jyufnxf", "link_id": "t3_167yfeb", "upvote_count": 57}, {"body": "You might need to get rid of the source of the smell. \n\nYou could try placing baking soda around the house or buying an air ionizer.

I wasn't a Regent's Scholar, only had a few high school activities, and didn't have a good idea of what I wanted to do in terms of my career. My resume definitely wasn't great, yet I managed to get past first and second round interviews for many competitive clubs and in fact, get in! And while being on the other end of these clubs, I'd find out that some of them had 10% acceptance rates and I managed to get in as a \"lowly\" freshman who honestly didn't have the best transcript (e.g. C+ in the math series at Berkley). \n\nBut now, as an upperclassman, my resume is much stronger. I started to improve by using active rather than passive voice when describing what I did in each activity and paint a much more cohesive story. My GPA has definitely bounced back from my first semester of freshman year. I included the different scholarships I won on in the \"honors/achievement\" part of my resume and all of the different extracurriculars and research projects I'm a part of as well and have made significant, measurable impact in, in addition to campus jobs I've held to afford living in Berkeley.

I'm not sure if it's because I'm later in my college career than before (though these clubs say they'll take all majors and years), or because I've never applied to their club before, or maybe they think I'm too busy or something because of my part-time jobs and research positions? Either way, I'm a little sad because I was really curious about consulting and wanted to learn more about what it's like through a club.

For L&S and most other colleges at Berkeley, the only credits that really give you subject credit are getting a 4+ in English Lang and/or a 5 in AP Lit.  These give you credit for the R&C classes.  For STEM majors, getting a 3+ in AP Calc AB and/or a 5 in AP Calc BC gets you subject credit for your 2 Calc classes (Math 1A and/or Math 1B).  If you are a Chem or Bio major, 4+ is AP Bio or AP Chem will get you credit.  Not sure about Physics, I think a 5 in AP Physics Mech gets you subject credit for Physics 7A but not such subject credit exists for Physics 7B.\n\nIf you plan to be a Psych or Econ major, getting a 4+ in AP Psych, or a 4+ in both AP Macro and AP Micro will get you subject credit for the first course for these majors. \n\nDo note that for L&S, AP classes do NOT give you subject credit for Breadth (gen Ed) classes. \n\nUnit credits give you credit towards the 120+ accumulation you need towards graduation.  Most standard AP classes will give you unit credits with a 3+ score.  AP classes that don\u2019t fulfill a subject credit that will fulfill a requirement will still count as an elective, so all is not lost for your APUSH or some other classes. \n\nVoid credits are credits you temporarily get, but go away when you take a class.  For example, if you get a 4 in AP Calc BC, you temporarily get the unit credits for the class since you got 3+, but you don\u2019t qualify for the subject credit.  Once you take Math 1B, the AP credit goes away, since you cant get credit for the same class twice. \n\nCoE operates with slightly different rules, which requires a different explanation.", "id": "jz1ds4g", "link_id": "t3_169aqk5", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "I appreciate your response, I plan on majoring in biochem :)", "id": "jz0qhaa", "link_id": "t3_169aqk5", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "Thank you for your response.

By sending them your transcript you\u2019re already showing what an outstanding student you are in your academic life so don\u2019t write your PIQ\u2019s solely about grades, school and academic life. Instead show them who you are as a person, who are you outside of school? What challenges did you overcome in life? Show them you are more than just a straight A student. \n\nThe reason behind this is because grades don\u2019t guarantee successes in life. A straight A\u2019s student who\u2019s only gotten A\u2019s in school, you don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react during times of distress. Will it destroy them? Or are the tough enough to push through? You have to prove that even during times of distress when you\u2019re at your lowest you can still handle yourself and pull through because that\u2019s what guarantees success in life not grades, and Berkeley wants students who have the potential to succeed in life not just school. \n\nSo write it from the heart and show them who you really are as person and how you deal with challenges life throws at you without ever giving up.

I'll answer with my story. I picked the PIQs that spoke to me, that helped me tell the most genuine story about myself. Don't hold back and try to make yourself \"look good\". Don't disclose anything traumatizing you feel uncomfortable about. However, struggles show personal fortitude. I  went over my drafts with transfer counselors, as they should know what universities want. I had considered consulting outside draft writers, my heart and family told me that that would be cheating, I'm no friggin cheater! I went five times (9 drafts in total). I sae 5 DIFFERENT councilors, preferribly ones who didn't know me. I needed objectivity, NOT comrodery. The last time, I saw the councilor I felt most comfortable with. Lastly, I showed my nearly final draft to my family member, who graduated from UCSD and GWU. He is VERY critical (Sentence structure, flow, punctuation) and I needed that also. If you see 6 people, expect 6 different critiques!!! In the end, YOU will have to give the final stamp of approval. Only you know when your story is being told correctly and ready for submission. They don't know you, so really let them (PIQ readers) know who you are.  Be humble and confident. No huberous, or arrogance, no bullshit. Share Your hopes, dreams, experiences, training, educational preparedness, fortitude, etc. Berkeley is NOT trying to admit people who are geniuses in the classroom, but selfish, self-centered jerks in the street. They don't want to produce evil geniuses!!! They want Changemakers, not painmakers. In the end, I did my best, and if they didn't want me, that was their loss, but it did work out and I am grateful.

While Reddit can be a valuable platform for information and connection, it can also sometimes foster negativity and reinforce certain behaviors. Taking time away from it can provide you with the opportunity to reflect on your interactions and habits. \n\nDuring this break, I encourage you to engage in self-reflection and self-improvement activities. Consider reading books that broaden your perspective, practicing mindfulness to become more self-aware, or volunteering to connect with others in a positive way.

Not because something is due, not because there is an exam the next day, but because that is the time that you work. Of course you need to prioritize the things that are due the earliest, but if you work 4-6 hours everyday you will probably never need to cram, do all nighters or start an assignment at the last hour. Take your schedule, see how many hours you have between classes, and add 4-6 hours everyday as your studying time. Go to the library and work for that time.

If you say you are going to study for an hour, but then spend 15min getting a coffee, 15 min checking reddit, 15 min studying and then 15 on youtube, you did not study an hour: you studied 15 min. You can check books like Deep Work or techniques like the Pomodoro technique to learn to differentiate the two. Otherwise you get stuck in a terrible cycle: you don't get anything done because you are always kind of studying, then you can't relax because you are always worried about the assignments you didn't finish, then you destroy your routine making up for it, then you are always tired, which makes it hard to concentrate, so you never get anything done.

ADHD is at its root a dopamine deficiency, and dopamine is what you need to get shit done, so even tho it seems paradoxical, look for ways to use dopamine and adrenaline to get shit done.  What works for me is the day before a paper is due, i go to Moffitt, drink a shit ton of coffee, and schedule some sort of plans (usually a party i really want to go to) for that night.  I also play really loud, fast, lyricless (or a diff language) music until i get into my groove (or get overstimulated, whichever comes first).  Anyway, the caffeine, deadline, and music drive me to get my shit done asap and then I\u2019m rewarded with partying.  Though, a healthier alternative that has also worked for me for less immediate deadlines or studying is working for 45-50 mins on whatever i gotta do, and playing 15-20 mins of Minecraft.

At the end of the day, there\u2019s no one way to accomplish ur things, and even when u find a method that works, at some point it might not work anymore, and that\u2019s fine.

But the progression in lessons is rather fast, which is interesting. I suggest you just adjust your study schedule because you will have other classes using Python, such as EECS 16A, so you might as well get the concepts down now. Personally, I skip most of my classes and just study all day in my dorm, watching the recordings whenever necessary. For CS61A, do all the assignments in advance and try to get a solid understanding of the Python syntax. For beginners, you have to invest significantly more time into this. For some reason, the class doesn't start off with the basic concepts of variables and whatnot. It's week two, and we are already doing higher-order functions and stuff, so it's not unusual that you are struggling, just power through.

CS wasn't crazy profitable for the first 50 years or so, esp. not at the coding monkey level (it used to be a lower-level admin job). It's not going to be the place to get 6k salaries straight out of school anymore, either.

Bio-tech PhDs are shorter than others, too, so it's not going to be 8 years. An extra 4 years is nothing in the grand scheme of your life, including being able to support your parents. It could in fact be a good short-cut to a long term high-paying job, without law or med school.\n\nOverall,  people are happiest doing something they like. . Look at how many sad pandas there are here forcing themselves into majors they hate. Imagine doing that until you retire with a bunch of money and no sense of deeper satisfaction of accomplishment? You're at one of the world's best universities, where almost every major has world-famous Profs teaching courses. Anything you do at Berkeley will set you up the same or better than anywhere else you'd go. On top of that, Berkeley is no.1 (tied) for bio-tech stuff.

Now that I\u2019m a senior, I\u2019ve come to learn: that\u2019s the point. Such tactics require that we learn to think more critically and learn how to learn. When we are out there in the \u201creal world\u201d we are going to be faced with many obstacles and challenges. Thus, we must know how to fend for ourselves, think for ourselves, but also bring questions to the table and know when and where to push back on ideas. (Of course, this is difficult because all throughout Cal I\u2019ve had many questions but have never been quite sure what to ask). It\u2019s up to us to figure it out. \n\nUltimately, I approach course work focusing on content and what my professors and GSI\u2019s want me to take away from the course rather than my final grade in a course (because, in my opinion, Berkeley is very difficult. You should simply expect some grade deflation. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s avoidable. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing anything wrong, it just means there are some things you can do better). \n\nMy goal in every course is to take at least one thing away from it. This is why it\u2019s so important to study and major in what you love, and take course that truly interest you. That said, my approach has yielded great results for me. My GPA is fine. A little deflation (which as mentioned, is to be expected), but barely noticeable. As long as you continue to troubleshoot you will figure out what works best for you and when you do, even though you feel like a hot mess, as long as you are truly doing the work, your GPA will remain in tact. \n\nI really appreciate your post because I think a lot of students feel this way when they start. I most certainly did. Berkeley is not a one size fits all. We all come in with our own structure, routine, and approach to coursework that we have perfected over time and Berkeley indiscriminately throws it all out the window.

I thought I was decently intelligent. Last minute I decided I wanted to have a highschool diploma. Went back and graduated on time. Did I earn my diploma? Yes. Did I learn anything? No. \nI tried community college for a few years, mostly to get the loans and grants. Found out I didn't know shit. Sounded stupid, missed the obvious clues, was way off all the time. That bothered me, inside the classroom and out. It bothered me how ignorant I was. \n\nFF 7 years and I decided I want to go to a University and learn. Once there, I fell in love with my field. I dove in headfirst. Rarely missed class, made a point to get to know my professors, even if it meant standing in line or waiting for them elsewhere on campus. Just to be recognized  by a publishing professor, and have a report with them, even in my first year, caused me to take everything very seriously. \n\nLecture is the expert literally telling you how to think about the subject as an expert does. Lecture taught me how to talk about the subject. How to recognize if someone else knew what they were talking about, how to recognize the bullshit. \n\n  Because I went to lectures, office hours, and hung around in my department lobby, I was offered a paid department student position with my own office and office hours \n   Numerous professors approached me to inform me if I ever should need a letter of recommendation, they would be glad to write one. \n   None of the above would have been possible if all that i cared about was the grade at the end. Im not a natural student. I struggled with alcohol and drugs going back to the 8th grade. But by my capstone I had my first straight A semester ever. \n\nI've met and known many college graduates who always got the good grades, but cannot think critically about the problems they face outside of school. They are followers because they have no other option. Nothing wrong with following a good leader, but develop the ability to think critically, to recognize sound ideas and parse them from all the bullshit.

I had to change it, and through practice (literally practicing in my head), and just attempting to talk to other people, and start conversations myself, it\u2019s honestly working!! I went from not being able to have a conversation, to being able to carry the conversation with a shy person and get them to talk more too. Something I do is I make a phrase or question that I use when I don\u2019t know what to say. And you do it right when the awkward silence is about to start. And it has to be something that is universal and relates to everyone, and also can develop into more conversation. I use the topic of food!

(they aren\u2019t like close friends yet I guess).\nBut i went to a social for a club tonight, and it was amazing!

Note that I am an extrovert and naturally enjoy being with and around people so if you're not going to engage with people you are not going to have an easy time making connections.  \n\nThe only person who is going to stop you from doing something fun is yourself. \n\nWhat did I do:\n\n(1) I lived in the transfer dorms. Close quarters living makes you forced to interact with various people. Maybe you will like them, maybe you won't but talk to the people on your floor and building, some of you will have the same interests or experiences. \n\n(2) Rushed greek life but didn't join. Going around and meeting people this way is great. You can meet the upper class people that are into the same things as you are, maybe you will want to have a built in friend group. Yes, greek life can be weird and it's not for everyone, but it's an experience. Don't knock it until you try it out. The worst thing that happens is you don't join a house. \n\n(3) Played a club sport. Trauma bonding over physical exertion is a great way to make friends. Teamwork helps build connections and deepens friendships. \n\n(4) Go to religious/ethnic specific events. Having people from a similar background gives you an easy way to establish a potential friendship. Also, it doesn't have to be your specific religion or ethic group. Going to learn and show up for other people is a great experience. If you want the best ethnic food, go to the club event. \n\n(5) I would compliment and strike up conversation with people that I found interesting. Cool hair, vibe, outfit? Tell them. It doesn't need to be more than that. Maybe they think you're flirting, that's fine. Just giving someone a compliment will go a long way for you and them anyway.  Someone says something interesting or a different thought in class or section? Ask them to discuss it more, maybe you do it over a beer or coffee. Taking a genuine interest in someone is a great way to break the ice. \n\n(6) Go to common hang out or university event. For example, hang out at I-House and have a glass of wine, espresso, or Italian soda. Go to a football, basketball, water polo, rugby, soccer, volleyball, or baseball game. Don't want to go alone, ask someone from one of your classes to join. They are a lot of fun, especially the \"smaller\" sports that have tight fan bases. Show up a few times and people will at the very least talk to you. \n\n(7) Co-ops are a vibe. Very welcoming and definitely unique. Go to a couple of them on a weekend to see if there are any parties and see if you like them. \n\n(8) Take a random De-Cal, ridiculous class, or something that is creatively oriented. Be weird and find something different to do that you are interested in learning. Underwater basket weaving, photography, or an intro to art class? Improv? Theater for Charity? Southpark or Simpsons DeCal? Some random anime/manga Decal? \n\n(9) If there isn't a club or anything that you like in existence at Cal, start it. I bet you will find at least one other weirdo that's into the same shit as you are. There are 30k people as students on campus odds of someone being as weird as you are high. \n\n(10) Find a charity that you are interested in working with. There are several causes that are on campus and around the area. Go get involved and see if you can help some people. Giving back is a great way to meet people that have similar core values. \n\nLastly, and this isn't an activity but, don't be a dick. Just be nice to people. If someone talks to you, don't give them a one word answer. Ask them about themselves. Be interested in their answer and be kind.

Similarly a girl in my GBO group and I got along well and have now done lunch a couple times and we text about random stuff and are well on the path to becoming friends. \n\nIt is inherently more of a challenge for transfers to become friends with people and even more so for older transfers who probably have more in common with GSIs and profs than the 18-19 year old freshmen etc.   my best advice is to give it time and let friendships develop organically.  We are only 3 weeks into the semester so there is plenty of time.     Going to club events etc can be great but look to the people who you see in classes.  Introduce yourself when someone new sits next to you.    By nature I\u2019m pretty introverted and making friends(especially as an adult) is challenging for anyone.  \n\nIt may seem kinda dumb but move around in your classes. Don\u2019t sit in the same spot surrounded by likely the same people.  Chit chat during Berkeley-time while the prof fumbles with the projector.

For example, D-Limonene is a highly corrosive paint stripper, and is used in perfume for its pleasant and citrusy aroma. Sounds kinda scary, but D-Limonene is found naturally in lemons and its usage is restricted to concentrations that are known to be topically safe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>female makeup products also being linked to forever petroleum based chemicals\n\nThis is a bit tricky as well. Many compounds are synthesized from petroleum derivatives. However, a lot of these compounds are identical to those found in plants and nature. A great example is vanillin. Vanillin is the compound responsible for the smell/taste of vanilla, and it can be synthesized from petroleum and polymers. Again, its bio-identical to the natural vanillin. As for makeup, makeup contains many different silicones and glycols that come from petroleum. But medications, soaps, toothpastes, and sun screen also contain these as binding and stabilizing agents. If these were dangerous or unsafe when used as intended, the FDA would have banned their usage. And contrary to what many people think, the FDA is VERY strict with cosmetics. They're buddy-buddy with pharmaceutical companies, but they are very critical of cosmetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you don't want to wear perfume or makeup, that's totally ok!

For example, you may not have been able to demonstrate your knowledge of a theorem on a math homework, and, in hindsight, learned it after making mistakes on the homework, but that doesn't mean you're entitled to points you don't deserve.

Feedback from previous years was consistently and reliably implemented, professors were proud to show us evidence of their improvement and accountability with our feedback/complaints. One literally happily presented us with 5 year graph of exams scores rising from average C to average B+/A- (note nothing was curved, so if class scored average D it remained average D...). As consistent uGSI I witnessed this improvement too.\n\nDespite not being a great test-taker, I managed to gain admission to Cal. Exams there had two attempts to reduce stress, allowing you to keep the highest score, even if you needed to retake the second attempt months later during resit periods. In one class, where homework accounted for 10% of the grade being due on Fridays at 5 pm, I struggled and only scored around 50%, preventing me from getting an A. So, timed assignments like that really are not my strong suit. I prefer one/two occasions for time pressure per class as opposed to continuous soul sucking experience.\r  \n\r  \nGrades in my opinion should be based solely on knowledge, not timeliness. While timeliness is philosophically speaking important, grading it is unfair to slower learners, those with busy schedules, or neurodivergent students in a meritocratic system.\r  \n\r  \nWe still had GSI's, discussion sections, and could reach out to professors anytime. Collaboration was encouraged, and blatant copying didn't make sense since ungraded assignments by definition cannot be cheated on. Looking up solution online is pointless unless you understand it and can reproduce it later yourself during exam. We genuinely learned from each other through discussion as opposed to just giving an answer and moving on.\r  \n\r  \nThe system was flexible and required self-accountability, which could be challenging. And yes, in those times I complained too (we are humans after all) :P However, the system made me feel respected as an adult, and I had to take responsibility for my actions for real. I was no longer in high school, and it showed. Solutions were provided weekly, and there were sometime even ungraded quizzes for self-assessment and exam preparation (again with solutions available). This allowed me to focus on real learning instead of constantly cramming for timed homework and quizzes focusing on right answers instead of taking time to understand why they are right. \n\nDespite entering college with massive exam anxiety from HS (literally had panic attacks anxiety), I actually got much better on them during this experience and had a lot less stress by graduation because I actually learned and was given ample opportunity to practice on my own terms.

With its endless hours of tailgating, drinking, and arguing, SEC football is the perfect way to waste your time and avoid doing anything productive with your life.\n\nBut why would anyone want to watch SEC football? Well, for some people, it's a way to feel like they're part of something. They may not have a job, a girlfriend, or a life, but they can still root for their team and feel like they're part of a community.\n\nFor others, SEC football is a way to escape from reality. They may be struggling with debt, addiction, or depression, but for a few hours on Saturday afternoon, they can forget about their problems and pretend that they're still in college.\n\nAnd then there are the people who just have nothing better to do. They're the ones who spend all day Saturday watching football, and then all day Sunday talking about it. They're the ones who know the names of every player on every team, and they can tell you the stats from every game that was ever played. They're the ones who will argue with you until they're blue in the face about why their team is better than yours.\n\nIf you're one of these people, then SEC football is the sport for you. It's a way to waste your time, avoid your responsibilities, and feel like a loser. So what are you waiting for? Start watching some football!\n\nBut seriously, SEC football is a waste of time. It's a distraction from the real world, and it's a way to avoid dealing with your problems. If you're looking for something to do with your life, SEC football is not the answer.\n\nSo go out there and do something productive. Get a job, start a relationship, or go back to school. There's a whole world out there, and you're missing out on it by watching SEC football.\n\nP.S. If you're still reading this, you probably have nothing better to do with your life.

Demographically, that means almost all current Cal undergrad students weren't even born, and what happened that day has become part of receding \"history\", not lived or personally remembered experience, for the majority of people on campus today.\n\nHere are a few things I'd suggest as brief reading (or viewing) to learn about Berkeley and 9-11 in particular. \n\nSix days after the attack, on Monday, September 17, 2001, there was a campus memorial gathering with an estimated 12,000 people, mostly students, in Memorial Glade north of Doe Library.  [https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/features/2001/09/tragedy\\_memorial/](https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/features/2001/09/tragedy_memorial/) There are several links to video and text.\n\nHere's the overall campus website page from 2001 with links to events and news articles [https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/specupdates/index.html](https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/specupdates/index.html)\n\nA Cal alumnus (and former Cal Rugby player), Mark Bingham, was a passenger on the hijacked Flight 93 which was headed from Newark, NJ, to SFO, and carried many passengers with Bay Area connections. Bingham was one of those who broke into the cockpit to re-take the plane from the hijackers before it crashed. The hijackers appeared to have been intending to fly that plane into either the White House or the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nHere's an article about the on-campus memorial service for Bingham. \n\n[https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/09/26\\_mcain.html](https://newsarchive.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2001/09/26_mcain.html)\n\nHere's an essay about him and, in particular, his identity as a gay Cal student and alumnus.\n\n[https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/gaybears/bingham/](https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/collections/gaybears/bingham/)\n\nAnd, finally, here's an essay that I read just this morning on the Daily Kos website (which was founded in Berkeley, by the way). The writer is spending the day at the memorial site in Pennsylvania for Flight 93. I have not previously come across a more evocative piece about Flight 93 and the ordinary (but also extraordinary) people on board that day, both flight crew and passengers. It may make you cry, but it's well worth reading. \n\n[https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/9/10/2192425/-When-Confronted-By-Evil-Passengers-And-Crew-Of-Flight-93-Fought-Back-And-Reclaimed-Their-Destiny](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2023/9/10/2192425/-When-Confronted-By-Evil-Passengers-And-Crew-Of-Flight-93-Fought-Back-And-Reclaimed-Their-Destiny)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "upvote_count": 1, "id": "16fyd44", "comments": [{"body": "Thanks so much for sharing this.

I am part of a fairly new mental health on campus called Fighting for Hope ([instagram plug](https://www.instagram.com/fightingforhope_cal/?hl=en)! give us a follow) and I've had a fair share of navigating resources on campus. Just wanted to let people know of my honest take on different resources, and what to do if you are ever struggling!\n\n**CAPS**: Besties! It takes forever to find the right therapist, so if your first appointment with CAPS is disappointing. I would recommend trying it again. In my first appointment, my therapist told me that I needed better coping mechanisms, and in my head I was like \"no shit sherlock\".  **When scheduling on-the-day appointments, make sure to do so before 10 AM or the night before to guarantee you an appointment. After trying to schedule on the day appointments, feel free to build a relationship with one of the therapist you like.** I did the same when I came in after a crisis, and now I have monthly appointments with her. It's not enough, but it's the bare minimum to keep my sanity in this school :)) They also have group therapy options, which I'll be trying soon! If you are really experiencing a crisis and are thinking of pushing through with an attempt, call them or walk-in. **They will prioritize you.** \n\n**DSP**: Sometimes, the best thing you could do is surrender and accept that you need help. If you need help getting documentation, CAPS can usually do it for you after 1-2 appointments. The long part is waiting for the Accommodations appointment where you ask what you specifically need to accomodate you. **Try to get your documentation asap.**\n\n**Crisis line**: Horrible and I wouldn't recommend using it. If any of you are feeling suicidal or having a crisis, please find a friend to stay the night with you or a roommate to just be in your presence. I would crash at my friend's places back when my suicidal thoughts were at my worst. Crisis line from my experience made me feel worst, and they made me feel like a problem/patient to be solved rather than a human being. \n\n**Office of Protection against Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD)** : As long as you don't reach out in the summer, you can get a response. It might take a while though, but they would reach out to you when you file a sexual assault case too.\n\n**IFC and Panhellenic Risk Management**: Kinda on the iffy end. The only benefit is that it remains anonymous. If you do end up experiencing sexual assault or rape in a fraternity or sorority, I would suggest proceeding with OPHD instead. The only thing the PHC can do is remove the fraternity from the social calendar, and the fraternity/IFC itself sometimes just do things to clear their name instead of solve their problem at hand. Not to blame the fraternities though, since they can't always ensure that all their members are not weird or sus. But, I felt like they could have taken more action. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*My DMs are open if any of you have any questions regarding picking yourself back up from burnout, balancing depression & anxiety, sexual assault or specific class resources, getting rid of suicidal thoughts, and campus resources <3 I still have a lot of ways to grow, but I would do my best to give advice as an upperclassmen :))*\n\n*Here's a reminder to learn to grow and become a better person from a place of self-love and forgiveness instead of your insecurities. You have inherent worth as a human being, and you don't have to prove yourself through academics, achievements, or actions to anyone.

I started at Berkeley during Covid and I've heard about a lot of the things you're saying, but personally have found that it's easy to avoid or cope with them.\n\nFor the recent EECS career fair, all I had to do was get there early and I was able to have great conversations with the companies there. At that career fair, in fact, there were companies that said \"Stanford, Berkeley, and MIT move on to the next round, sorry to everyone else\" (is it not astounding to people that we are the only public university that actually rolls with the big guys in basically everything????). I've been an AI for two large lower-div CS classes and frankly the Lab/OH loads I've had to handle weren't bad at all. The only time I would say it's been truly hellish was during the UC-wide GSI strike where we had to do Project 3 in 162 without OH support. The funding crises aren't unique to us either -- basically every public university is dealing with similar situations right now. Additionally, I've been an officer (leading all of the club's developers) in a CS club that does projects for local startups and we basically admitted everyone who put some level of effort into their application and didn't come off as rude or BS-ing in their interview (and there was only one interview).\n\nThe problems you're mentioning definitely exist, but they aren't unique to Berkeley or reflective of the university as a whole.\n\nThere are actually some things we do quite well in comparison to Stanford. During Covid, we all had to fill out some forms to get the bureaucratic stuff going, no matter which university we were at. My friend at Stanford told me the process seemed like a collection of obscure and disparate tasks and forms, and extremely confusing compared to Berkeley, where we could just find everything on CalCentral. Last year, I got an internship at a company based a block off campus by DM-ing the CTO of that company on LinkedIn (and my manager in that internship has been putting in good words for me in my current job search). I have gotten invited to meetups in SF and have been able to meet with people at the top of their fields across a number of industries (one of whom is now helping me out) because I reached out to a VC who is faculty here who made some introductions for me. I seriously doubt I'm alone in enjoying these pros and I'm wondering why no one promotes experiences like these when talking about this school. I think there are a lot of great things about Berkeley that don't get nearly as much press as the cons because everyone seems to care about \"the college experience\" (whatever that actually means, and it strikes me as a similar vibe to whatever Sahai means when he says \"mathematical maturity\") among other things.\n\nI understand Berkeley requires resourcefulness and a strong work ethic to succeed, but this is definitely not unique to Berkeley. In general, I'm inclined to believe that the success of students from a particular university is mostly based on their levels of resourcefulness, hard work, and ambition rather than the \"prestige\" of their university. Hence, I think the best universities are those that force their students to be resourceful, hardworking, and ambitious.\n\nThis turned out a lot longer than I intended.\n\nTLDR: My 2 cents are that seeking out a university that forces you to be resourceful, hardworking, and ambitious (which Berkeley does very effectively) is more important than optimizing for \"quality-of-life\" which is largely under one's own control, and the aspects of Berkeley that pay dividends on the work you put in and the values you gain from being here are not given nearly the attention they deserve.", "id": "k0iq6y0", "link_id": "t3_16ia6nr", "upvote_count": 13}, {"body": "I feel like it really depends on the positions that you\u2019re expressing though.

There are like 40,000 people who go here, they don\u2019t all turn against you because like 10 people did. \n\nIf you get dropped from a friend group, then go around complaining to everyone you\u2019re trying to befriend that people are too woke and can\u2019t handle your political views, it comes off as a red flag and might turn them off.

Then they went on to talk about how much they're gonna be making and how they have a whole ass plan after college. \n\nWell, after she left I saw her crying outside and I went over and she said she feels like her life is over and she feels so alone and behind for not having job searched yet and not knowing for sure what career she wants. I told her the TRUTH which is that no one really knows what they want in their early twenties and that she'll be able to find a job (she's a media studies major and i told her that's a huge plus because a. it's a berkeley degree and b. she can do sales, tech writing, or whatever she wants after school and make a killing)!\n\nAnyway, what stuck out to me is how a careless conversation can really make someone else feel small and terrible. And it also sucks that she feels alone. A MAJORITY of students haven't started looking and don't feel like they have their shit together. Yea, we go to a competitive school, so some of what we hear and see is skewed but there are jobs out there for every college graduate. And no major is useless - a degree from Berkeley is a degree from Berkeley! \n\nJust please be mindful and if any of you are in her situation please take a deep breath and know you're not alone and you're in a better place than most just having to opportunity to get a degree :)", "upvote_count": 1, "id": "16iab14", "comments": [{"body": "preach", "id": "k0im9dq", "link_id": "t3_16iab14", "upvote_count": 63}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|M8o1MOwcwsWOmueqN4)", "id": "k0ioznz", "link_id": "t3_16iab14", "upvote_count": 50}, {"body": "This post must be read by more people at Cal.

The moment we left the store we were stopped by multiple men telling us they were watching us and that we didn\u2019t pay for the hat. We were very apologetic and trying to explain that we didn\u2019t in fact try to steal but simply forgot to pay for it. We offered to go and pay for it so we can be on our way. But they said no, saying they\u2019ll take away his membership card if we didn\u2019t go to the office with them.\n\nSo we went to the office hoping to pay for the hat and maybe just get a warning because it was in no way intentional. However, they kept interrupting and making fun of us while we were trying to explain our side. They accused us of trying to conceal it with chicken bakes because the chicken bakes ended up on top of the hat when we were packing them into a box. We didn\u2019t have a cart so it would be impossible to carry everything without a box. I also lifted up the squishmallow plushie that was on top so the lady at the exit could check out everything. The lady marked our receipt checked with a blue marker before we stepped outside.\n\nIn the office, they told us they were watching us the entire time. Yet no one approached us to correct our mistake. They said \u201coh yeah we know college kids like you that totally don\u2019t mean it\u201d in a very demeaning way. I brought up the fact that he paid for the entire year so will we receive a refund? They said made a remark saying \u201cno, they will steal it\u201d. Extremely unprofessional and inappropriate response to already stressed out young adults. \n\nI understand that people steal but as a full time college student and a part time worker, I work hard to earn money to pay for things.

If, for example, you are in CS at Berkeley and you\u2019re white then you are in a massive minority. My family just toured a bunch of schools and when we at UCI there was two pages of student names posted on a door for a seating chart in the CS building. There were about 50 names. 2 of them where white names, 2 were Indian and 2 were South American. The other 44 names were Asian. It\u2019s basically the same at all UCs because they cannot look at race as part of admissions. So it\u2019s majority Asian (Indian and Chinese if you break it down). And don\u2019t lambast me about being racist or some shit - go check the UC data available online from the UCs themselves. You can sort and filter by school and degree program. \n2. If the poster above was accurate about races sticking together (and study data for the us indicates that he is right - salad bowl vs melting pot) and you\u2019re in the minority then you\u2019re going to have a much smaller pool of people that you gel with or that will accept you. Now you know how non-whites have felt for a few centuries! \n3. Who gets into Berkeley - at least for stem classes? It\u2019s all kids with 4.5 gpa or higher, 9+ AP classes in high school, all with 5 scores, 4 years in robotics club with wins at national championships, violin since they were 5, starting a volunteer organization, etc etc. These are not kids that were social or made friends - generally speaking. These were ultra competitive, zero-sum kids (I win, you lose) willing to sacrifice basically everything to get into Berkeley, Stanford, MIT etc. What makes you think that once they get to college that they are suddenly going to be social butterflies? Now they\u2019re competing for who gets the job at Facebook! \n\nMy kid is a senior in high school with a 4.5 and 9 APs (but only 8 5s!) and I\u2019m trying to tell him to not even bother applying to Berkeley. I think it\u2019s highly overrated and full of people he has gone to high school with who are just \u201cnot his people\u201d, mostly for the reasons stated above. \n\nFinally, you make friends by putting yourself out there and by being willing to be rejected. Be yourself, say hi, smile, follow good personal hygiene, don\u2019t dress like a slob and stand and walk tall like you\u2019re proud to be you. Fake it if you need to! Figure out what you want to do with your day and invite people to join you. Go to the beach go for a run play volleyball try to code some cool new app whatever it is that floats your boat.

I\u2019m saying *only* because with my parents\u2019 insurance it was going be a lot more at other places. The whole procedure was pretty straightforward too: I schedule an appt for a consultation, got my surgery scheduled, had my surgery done, and I was good to go in less than two weeks. My face looked completely normal after and during my recovery period. I also got my annual dental cleanings with them as well.\n\n\n- I had my annual check-ups at the Tang Center and whenever I was prescribed anything, I would only have to pay between $5-$15 for each medication. At one point I was referred to an allergy center and I paid very little. Even x-ray examinations weren\u2019t that expensive.\n\n-This was my absolute fav thing and it was being referred to an RD, a registered dietitian. Most, if not all of the students at Cal will experience some sort of food/eating problem. Whether it is not having access to adequate/healthy food, an ED, or even have a bad relationship with food. Having a registered dietitian really helped me work on some of the problems that I had going on with my eating habits and my relationship with food and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. As students, you already have a lot going on with school and if you need the extra support, get the help that you need.\n\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great insurance to have! Some of my friends even used it to get prescribed acutane, so def use it for what you need. And no, you\u2019re not expecting too much\ud83d\ude04 def use it!!

I can't deny that she's an excellent professor, and I genuinely want to excel in her class, but this crush is making it challenging to focus on the academic side of things.\n\nSo, Reddit, what's going on with me?

Of course they'll teach it in class but it'll be glanced over. I'd recommend taking EECS127 concurrently/ DATA140 or EECS126 beforehand.\n\n-Workload, those problem sets will be tough, regardless of any prof. I'd estimate probably 10 to 20 hours per pset, and for the hard ones like math weeder or the neural net coding, probably like 30 hours.\n\n-Classical Algorithms, you won't be learning anything too in depth about neural networks like conv nets, transformers, GNNs, or any SOTA architectures today like you will in 182.

I went to a tech magnet HS that had a large department dedicated to animation and CIG training. Prior to going to college, I wanted to be a visual effects artist. I was friends with TONS of other art kids who wanted to be storyboard artists, background painters, character designers etc. Very fucking talented people imho. After HS, most of my friends went to Art Center Pasadena (art school). But the \"golden ticket\" for animation is Cal arts. If you graduate from Cal arts, you'll have no problem finding work at Disney or Cartoon Network. In my case, I managed to get a job-shadowing gig at Disney Jr. in Burbank. I enjoyed my time there, but I felt that getting hired based off of \"portfolios\" and \"talent\" is a breeding ground for nepotism and personal favors. So I decided to invest more in my education and pursue a career in soft IP and entertainment law :). Hence why I am here now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can't help but wonder, what kind of \"art\" do you want to be doing? In animations case, very few people have BAs, but most have BFA or MFA.

My ultimate goal/concern is not really about whether I end up getting 1 of them, but mainly to increase my personal values in order to attract girls in general. I've been working hard to increase my personal values that is still possible to improve, such as working out(I used to be slim like a stick, now barely have some muscles), raising my confidence and the tone I talk (before I couldn't even look at people in the eyes), learning about female psychological mechanics on youtube, and learning about the fundamentals of dating, listing out 100+ sentences and how to reply back on google docs. After some encounters with my female friends, I've come to realize a significant personal shortcoming: my conversational skills. Frequently, I find myself in situations where I become stuck and struggle to continue or expand on the conversation because I don't know what to say next, which makes the situation awkward. I feel like this is the thing that lowers my attractiveness the most, not my look.\n\nEven though I learned a lot about how to talk to girls or anyone in general, I feel like I still need someone to train me, as I believe this skill lacks a general formula. Even though I listed out 100+ of what she say & how you reply, irl the things she says is way more than 100, so the range I cover with my cheat sheet is approaching 0%, and most of the time you need to initiate the conversation, not waiting for them to speak first. Just like in CS70 even if you know clearly what is a bipartite graph, how error correcting code works, you still might not be able to solve some questions, because they require flexible mathematical thinking, which is about mathematical maturity, a very general skill.\n\nThe training I am looking for is not just giving me broad advice, such as \"do this, do that, don't do this, don't do that\", but more like giving me some actual examples that's possible to encounter irl, and see how I speak back, and give comments about the way I talk and what could I say instead to make it better.\n\nBackground info: I'm a typical sophomore CS+math Asian boi, 5\"7.5, kinda slim, not ugly at all, but far away from hot. I'm kinda weird: really shy and introverted to people that I'm not friend with, but talk a lot to people I'm super close with. I dropped CS61C so my time is a bit more flexible now.\n\nRight now I sort of have a big picture of my life plan in the future. ~10 years, and I decided that the best time to date and find a gf is in college. Reason being:\n\n1.\t\u2060A lot of girls have no past relationship experience, which lowers the difficulty significantly\n2.\t\u2060Right now money is not in the equation. The mean of attraction is not money, but your personality, which is good because if you attract girls by money, they will end up leaving you also because of money\n3.\t\u2060More time together until marriage, making relationship stable (My parents were middle school classmates, and their relationship has remained exceptionally strong. Throughout my entire life, I've never witnessed them engage in a major argument.)\n4.\t\u2060The younger, the better (treat it as a joke)\n\nIf anyone is interested in giving me a personal training, pls dm me or add me discord Bee Chasny#4628", "id": "k1335oo", "link_id": "t3_16kmut3", "upvote_count": 2}, {"body": "You\u2019re rlly living up to your reddit username.

I understand it sounds unbelievable, but this is happening a block away from UC Berkeley and affecting the whole building where I live. I did not post anything that could be a threat to others or myself, nor threaten to do so. I am reposting it guessing that the news flair was incorrect, so I am using the politics one. All of this speech was something I did not prepare to do, had anything planned out, written down, or anything. I am doing this willfully by myself to explain what is happening right now in front of everyone and to ask genuinely for help from the community of Berkeley to pass laws against Brain Data gathering without the full consent of all the parties. It is not intended to advertise any of my social media, it is just the most honest thing that I can do under torture and violation of human rights in plain sight. This is only possible because it sounds impossible: that is why it can be done in plain sight, nobody will believe me, the police won't do anything, and no one is happy with this. My family is really suffering).\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but I am 100% serious and I need your help. I have barely used Twitch (and I am not livestreaming much of anything else), my family is in danger and it is hard to believe, but if you do, you can change the world.\n\nI am being 100% honest and I am not high nor suffering from psychosis (as a matter of fact, I know all the antipsychotics because I had to suffer them because of suspicion of that, but you cannot record hallucinations). I know it is hard to believe without proof some random weird stranger on the Internet, I understand how weird this is, but I am asking the Berkeley Police Department to stop this torture that is happening just a block away from UC Berkeley right away. It is not a prank, joke, game, tv, gameshow, etc. I am a human being and I deserve dignity like everybody else. It can be too late if you don't show some empathy for this. I had nothing to lose until my brother became a father and I have my niece to have as a friend and to learn from her, who is amazing.\n\nMy life has been torture since August 2020, in the Bay Area, and I have been a resident and a citizen since 2014, escaping persecution from Venezuela, being the son of two Paraguayan political activists who risked everything for democracy in South America and I am second generation survivor of the Operation Condor. My journalist friends from Venezuela have been informed, but it is impossible to believe that I am not just crazy now, but it was impossible to believe that a voice could be modulated by a machine learning program just a year ago if someone claimed it.\n\nI do not adhere to any conspiracy theory, nor claim to know who is doing this or why it is happening.\n\nI do not have delusional thoughts about it. I just cannot keep living this way. I am being tortured with a psychosis simulator. It is the most horrible thing in the world, and I finally have the guts to open up. My other social media/Internet presence is entirely around this, I don't have friends because it is impossible to say this to someone and that they would believe it at all, and it is an incredibly big part of my life. The mental health services of Berkeley, one of the richest cities of the richest state of California have not been able to provide any help at all, and they assume that there is nothing that they can do for me. They have acknowledged the harassment around me, and I have shown them the recording of the hallucinations but I assume that they don't have any idea of what to do either. I am not a YouTuber, influencer, politician, troll, anything but human.\n\nMy weird speech is a resource I am using to survive this alone, talking to my plants. My neighbors probably don't know what is happening but I have reasons to believe that they know that it is happening and I assume that they don't know what to do. I would not know what to do in these circumstances either. It is becoming more and more likable to be \"viral\", what is happening to me, is something just normal, and this is me speaking up, as badly and brokenly as I can, but as honestly as I am.\n\nLet's stop this before Brain Data extraction without consent gets out of control, it is the logical next step for computer interfaces, and the city of Berkeley can make legislation that can change the course of history, possibly.\n\nSincerely, \n\nChristian Bogado Mars\u00e1", "upvote_count": 1, "id": "16m0ab4", "comments": [{"body": "Wanna play minecraft I found a huge village", "id": "k15e2pl", "link_id": "t3_16m0ab4", "upvote_count": 6}, {"body": "Posting here ain't gonna reach the people that can help you.", "id": "k15aup5", "link_id": "t3_16m0ab4", "upvote_count": 6}, {"body": "[removed]", "id": "k15emef", "link_id": "t3_16m0ab4", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "Not social media IMO", "id": "k15gh3r", "link_id": "t3_16m0ab4", "upvote_count": 2}]}, {"title": "CAEE", "body": "Is there a way to know ahead of time when a  CAEE tutor session gets canceled or is it standard to figure out after reaching ?

Hell, it could even be a weekly thing like maybe you decide you'll get yourself a Starbucks every Sunday or something, Idk.

Also, the idea of an \"elite\" experience is one manufactured by these dumb rankings.", "id": "k1fe9e9", "link_id": "t3_16mjng0", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "It\u2019s pretty exaggerated to say that you can have this background and then do research with a Nobel prize winner/Turing award winner/etc. There are thousands upon thousands of students gunning for those positions, and the truth is the probability of getting them is dramatically lower than at private schools. Hence, fewer students can leverage the opportunity.\n\nYou can argue against smaller class sizes all you want, but you and I both know they\u2019re better and are meaningful. So you can say it doesn\u2019t matter 8% of the ranking\u2019s worth but it certainly is >0%. Other threads on [this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/62t7jw/how_true_are_the_statements_about_ridiculously/) have comments like \u201cit\u2019s not *that* bad.\u201d It\u2019s ironically pure copium to claim that having 5,000 others kids in a class to a single professor is just as good as having 20. \n\nRegardless of how you frame it, a professor at Cal has less time for any given student than at a private university. A research position in a specific lab group has 10x more applicants, etc. And you\u2019re competing with a substantially larger graduating class for jobs that don\u2019t take Berkeley alumni at a proportionally higher rate. Not to mention, Berkeley isn\u2019t a target for finance, etc. And there are fewer financial resources per capita invested in support systems, etc. With all this in mind, by what possible metric are you arguing an individual student at Berkeley gets more out of going there than to a top private college if cost were the same? It\u2019s largely indefensible. Your claims thus far have been \u201cit\u2019s not that bad\u201d and \u201cBerkeley does good by providing education for more students.\u201d People don\u2019t attend colleges based on the social nobility of an institution or how much good it is generally perceived to do; if they did, Cornell would be the best Ivy. And if your arguments are so outright true, why is it people largely would prefer to go to Stanford (even among Berkeley students) if, by individual (graduate program) departments, Berkeley is academically stronger? \n\nGood on you that you went to office hours and got noticed by a faculty member, who could write you a rec for a T3 PhD. But just imagine that in a private college, that professor\u2019s OH time is now distributed among fewer students, plus the faculty remembers your face just from in-class and has looked at your homework assignments. How much deeper do you reckon the connection runs there? It\u2019s substantial. I can email any professor I\u2019ve ever had and they\u2019ll easily remember me and could write me a rec, even though I haven\u2019t been to their office hours (which, yes you can use to chat with faculty but is ultimately for asking questions about the course content, etc., and if you just go in everytime without questions about the class\u2026). I am friends with the undergraduate chair of my *school*, for example. There was the head of a major national lab who taught a 15 person class at my university, knowing each of us so intimately (not even from office hours necessarily), as well as the quality of our work, our academic backgrounds, etc. that she could confidently set anyone from that class up immediately with a research position.\n\nAlso, you *can* transfer from CC to top private colleges. I think you\u2019re underestimating the fraction of low-income students colleges like Princeton admit and fully support, giving them far more money than they could have at Berkeley, letting them graduate entirely debt-free. I know because my high school was a majority low income competitive public school, and almost everyone who got into a top private college would have paid less there than at a top public college. The data supports that the best private colleges give better finaid to those who need it. Sure, you can\u2019t be a terrible high school student, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a relevant contention.", "id": "k1fatn3", "link_id": "t3_16mjng0", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "And where do you propose this money is allocated, then? Financial aid? Per undergraduate, private colleges have more faculty.

I still have yet to see anyone mention how a lecture with thousands of students where the professor sticks to a script out of a textbook differs from watching the recording/a video on YouTube. A smaller class with <30 people doesn\u2019t observe this issue. They\u2019re interactive, allow for questions, respond to where students are seen to struggle on assignments, etc. This is especially true with classes that can be framed like \u201ctopics\u201d courses, are more discussion-based despite being STEM, etc. The lectures become a bidirectional experience.

Use flirty language in text, especially if you are a girl.\n\ne.x. in a class groupchat, ask for help like this: \"Haalllloooo frienddsss. :o Hasssss anyone understood the car and cdr parts of the assignment LOL ;\\_;\"\n\nBuilt up a very wide network so people can't screw you over even if what you do is messed up, the network will have your back. \n\n2. Never volunteer yourself to help others. When you hear the professor talking about class averages, then you ask in chat what the avg was. Otherwise don't ask anything else. Be very discrete about this, other people's tears/failures/losses feed your joy.    :o\n\n3. Ditch people who are useless and network with the smartest and most accomplished people. For example, if you are at Calhacks and you are with an extremely smart person and an technically incapable one. Ditch that team by telling that person \"Hey \\[person x\\] I'm going to join another team, so this one is disbanded. :o \". When you see them both in the future, don't apologize to the useless one, talk to the smart one to repair the damage. Don't feel sorry for the losers. Hanging out with turkeys will prevent you from soaring. \n\n4. Be very quiet, observant, and talk only when necessary, observe people to see their characteristics and what you can use, exploit from them. \n\n5. Aggressively ask people for things, but gatekeep them for yourself with a vague/bullshit answer. If for example, in an intro to CS seminar, if the professor asks,\"How many of you want to be swe's?\" DON'T RAISE YOUR HAND, you may motivate potential competititors to surpass you. Use intimidation tactics such as those from HBO Chernobyl or Gordon Ramsay. \n\nExample 1. make up a bullshit reason to get info from someone, (e.x. use your club leadership power) to ask what are stem alumni doing. And if they ask you back, ignore them.\n\nExample 2. If you are in charge of sending a team to the competition, subtly bribe the organizers to change the language into something you know, such as Swift. Then to the members, tell them last minute that the original competition in Algorithms was changed to swift and tell them they made a last minute change to the competition to screw them over. That way, your team has the advantage.\n\nExample 3. Tell your competitive threats that the competition is for girls only. Then secretly add a guy (e.x. Benqi) on your team, and rub it in people's faces by naming your team Bachelorettes+1 to flex your ego and power.  \n\n6. Gaslight people and make them feel guilty to gain ultimate control. If they don't respond to your messages as club lead, say things like \"Don't give me the bullshit you were busy.\" or \"Executive decisions don't care about your opinion!\" or (in person) \"People must show me absolute respect!\"\n\n7. Secretly and subtly spread true gossip (amplify just a bit but subtly) about people to undermine their reputation and protect your own interests. E.X. When tutoring at a library, subtly tell the kids something like \"Unlike this guy I can help you.\" or when someone goofs up volunter and say it in a way to make him look bad very subtly \"I will fix his mistakes.\"\n\nSpread gossip in social circles adjacent to your competition's social circles. That way when the gossip infiltrates their social circle the competition won't even know where it came from, so they can screw people over \n\n8. Become money driven. Even your sense of humor must tie into money. E.X. when you see a house, jokingly ask \"How much does it cost\"? Worship numerology, dragons, red string, jade, leperchauns, golden pots, horshoes, gold coins with squares cut in them, supserstition, whatever it takes to help gain advantage over others and become $$$$$$$$$. Invest in crypto, bitcoin, and trading early on to get that delicious money. \n\n9. Play common, but prestigious racquet sports for smart people (tennis, badminton), but watch basketball, other popular sports to get along with the masses. These sports are super athletic and only smart/driven people play this sport and rise to a very skilled level. Don't actively play the sports for free time, only play them to network with people as necessary, as they are for people with lower IQ's and fewer accomplishments. (e.x. track is for dumber people with no hand coordination) Don't go for golf or horse riding as the network is powerful, they are too small of a minority. Instruments like piano and violin can be ignored as they are perceived as more Asian than tennis (applies to Asians only), ping pong, badminton. etc.\n\n&#x200B;", "upvote_count": 1, "id": "16ml19s", "comments": [{"body": "Lol", "id": "k18vinu", "link_id": "t3_16ml19s", "upvote_count": 8}, {"body": "TLDR: Be a prick", "id": "k191cvu", "link_id": "t3_16ml19s", "upvote_count": 7}, {"body": "gaslight gatekeep girlboss", "id": "k1a4xs5", "link_id": "t3_16ml19s", "upvote_count": 3}, {"body": "most selfless cs major", "id": "k1bwuyl", "link_id": "t3_16ml19s", "upvote_count": 2}, {"body": "Ur mean \ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25", "id": "k1a22me", "link_id": "t3_16ml19s", "upvote_count": 0}, {"body": "Wow, you wrote a book!

This means that without any prior notice or warning, we could lose our '@berkeley.edu' email addresses, which for many of us, are a symbol of our time, achievements, and identity tied to Berkeley.\n\n**Why this is a big deal:**\n\n1. **Identity & Legacy:** Our Berkeley email isn't just for correspondence. It signifies our connection to one of the world's premier institutions. The sudden loss could affect networking, job-seeking, and our collective identity as alumni.\n2. **Professional Setbacks:** Many of us, especially recent graduates, have shared our Berkeley emails on resumes, with professional contacts, for research purposes, and more. An abrupt disconnection can cause unexpected disruptions.\n3. **Alumni Connection:** This email is a symbol of our ongoing relationship with UC Berkeley. Cutting it off feels like we're being distanced from our alma mater.\n\nTo address this, there's a petition circulating on Change.com titled [**\"Don't Disconnect Us: Our '@berkeley.edu' Email Is More Than Just An Address!\"**](https://chng.it/c6CPC6nx6K). The petition emphasizes the significance of these email addresses and requests UC Berkeley to introduce a purchase option for future graduates. By rallying together, we can make our voices heard.\n\n*Processing img r7r2duuvqcpb1...*\n\n**How you can help:**\n\n1. **Sign the Petition:** Every signature counts. Let's make sure UC Berkeley hears us loud and clear.\n2. **Spread the Word:** Share this on other social platforms, with your Berkeley friends, and anyone else who can help champion our cause.\n3. **Share Your Stories:** How has the '@berkeley.edu' email been crucial for you?

I'm an international and I've been in the US for 3 years now.

Unless you're asking these clubs to employ some sort of diversity hire / affirmative action policies which is honestly just more insulting to minorities at this school.\n\nLike I said, nepotism definitely exists here.

There is neither a subconscious nor conscious desire to make an asian monolithic culture in these clubs.

At the bottom of the curve is the \"good enough\" guys and they take the date they can get as they are on the yield curve that gets some matches.Many men trying on apps will be in the \"not worth the effort\" because the selected photos that a woman has on their profile is their best angle, best makeup, best day of the week, etc. To match that level of vibe that side of the match may have to spend time prepping their outfit, makeup, mood boost. What ends up happening like with op is that a \"casual meet\" is too much effort if they've never met before. Either side getting that ambiguous feeling of being \"frumpy today\" has caused no-showsIf Op is really is getting matches set a quick date while they are already out of the house, so they have a baseline of having gotten done up and what they see as presentable and is just a little more additional effort. Set a time limited meet. Meet at a cafe between classes then transition it to inviting to a more committent of time with either pizza or any sports game that you are both excited about. Might just need to renegotiate the cancelled plans with this option to at least get that first impression out of the way. Then it becomes a true yes/no. This quickdate is great because they will feel great all day. Their makeup choice and dress choice may be peak and they'd get compliments (guys don't know this but compliments flow more with women) and put them in a great mood going into the meet.", "id": "k1qa3xs", "link_id": "t3_16olg0y", "upvote_count": 2}, {"body": "Yes.

Many of those classes were foundational, and I'd be going back to take upper divisions with no real memory of the intro classes. *Do any fellow returnees have advice about how to catch up and/or refresh their memory?* I'm planning on finding a tutor but this has me scared. \n\nI completed 87 units during the first run as well, and while I'd like to switch majors, it's looking like that will put me near the unit ceiling just to knock out prereqs (potentially switching from College of Engineering to L&S). *Does anyone have experience getting an extension from the university?* Maybe I'll have to complete some classes at a CC? I'll be talking to major advisors next about this, but would love advice from folks who have already been there.\n\nI'm excited to return, but I'm also nervous as I have some trauma from the circumstances that led to my withdrawal.

I went through them pretty fast and found they came back to me quickly.\n\nWhen classes start, my top two recommendations are easily, 1) GO TO OFFICE HOURS and 2) try to mix in studying with other classmates. I made myself go to every office hour and asked a looot of questions. It was tremendously helpful for understanding lecture and getting homework help. I also spent a lot of time in the common room working with my classmates (I had to commute so I ended up spending time in the common room before going home). Explaining lecture concepts to each other and working on/comparing homework really helped to internalize everything.\n\nI was worried I wouldn't even pass since it had been 8 years, but I ended up scoring at the top of the class in the end.

And contrary to the protestors claims, de Valle is the one who has been found guilty of sexual harassment, not the other professor.\n\nHere are some highlights from the article:\n\n1. \"UC-Berkeley\u2019s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination conducted **three separate Title IX investigations** on the case \u2014 in 2019, 2021, and 2022. **All found that \\[professor del Valle\\] had either harassed \\[the other professor\\] or violated orders not to contact him.\"**\n2. \"In November 2019, **Berkeley\u2019s harassment-prevention office concluded that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d \u2014 the preponderance-of-evidence standard used in policy-violation cases \u2014 that del Valle had engaged in conduct that amounted to stalking, sexual harassment, and retaliation...** for \\[the other professor's\\] having reported her to the university.\"\n3. \"Berkeley opened a second investigation. In a report issued that November, it concluded that del Valle had violated the university\u2019s 2020 no-contact order on four separate occasions: when **she left derogatory messages about Clover near his mother\u2019s house and also at that of a neighbor, sent emails to his peers and colleagues, and created a Twitter account that tried to follow Clover\u2019s students.**\"\n4. \"In late 2020 and early 2021, Clover\u2019s mother, Carol J. Clover, an emerita professor at Berkeley, reported that **someone had dumped what looked like chunks of rotten pineapple covered with oil at her doorstep and chalked insults about her son on the sidewalk in front of her home.** Her security camera captured fuzzy footage of someone investigators later concluded, **\u201cmore likely than not,\u201d was del Valle... Del Valle told The Chronicle that she takes responsibility for those actions and that she was punished for them with a nine-month unpaid suspension.\"**\n5. \"That spring and summer, del Valle also unleashed a cascade of angry, expletive-laden emails and voice mails at Clover, the investigation said. In one voice mail, the 2019 investigation reported, del Valle said: \u201cYou need to still call me and apologize or you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m not afraid of you. ... I\u2019m not afraid of anything because I am right.\u201d **Del Valle keyed Clover\u2019s car, and sprayed messages in silver paint inside the hall of his apartment building and on his front door calling him a \u201csex addict\u201d and \u201csick harasser.\u201d**\n\nI sincerely hope that the University is able to keep her off campus, and that the students and faculty enabling her continuing harassment of this professor take a long look in the mirror.", "id": "k6ihr0z", "link_id": "t3_16orvt1", "upvote_count": 16}, {"body": "Older story: https://dailycal.org/2023/08/29/protestors-gather-in-california-hall-demand-reinstatement-of-uc-berkeley-professor", "id": "k1mhtlo", "link_id": "t3_16orvt1", "upvote_count": 29}, {"body": "Why is she on administrative leave?

For instance, it\u2019s very common for a cyclist to cycle into my blind spot when I\u2019m slowing down to take a right turn even when my blinker is on. It happens so often in fact, I just let them pass and then I turn. \n\nAlso, your points in (2) are just characters of bad drivers. What are the odds that a lot of the drivers in Berkeley around the campus just got or recently obtained their drivers licenses? I purchased a car for my brother who goes to another university and when I was looking for used cars around the campus area where he lived,  the majority of the cars for sale were once \u201csalvage title\u201d which means the cars were previously totaled in a car accident but repaired. Why is this, lots of new drivers in a concentrated area.\n\nI think the general \u201centitlement\u201d that people think car drivers have while driving is actually just an illusion. A lot of people don\u2019t realize it, but cars have a ton of blind spots in them and it\u2019s hard to have a good mental awareness around your car. Also, driving in a car is also an optical illusion. From the inside of the car, it looks like you are driving slower than you actually are. So a lot of drivers will drive fast unintentionally.

(I don't bicycle because I have some periodic balance problems, and it would be unsafe for me and people around me.)\n\nWe will probably not get anywhere debating which class--car drivers, or bike riders--is worse in Berkeley, and in what specific ratio of terrible drivers/riders to decent ones. So, setting that aside, my observations would be:\n\n\\- in my own experience, many *bike riders are as awful to pedestrians as many car drivers are to both pedestrians and cyclists.* Uncounted times in Berkeley when I've been walking I've had cyclists cut me off, zoom in front of me in a crosswalk without warning, or roll down a narrow sidewalk at me and expect me to jump out of the way. It's as if getting up on a wheel--one, two, or four--makes some people act out being horribly inconsiderate.\n\n\\- Berkeley bike riders vehemently argue *\"we're vehicles, we have all the rights of the road!\"*, which is legally true. But that does not stop many local bike riders from flagrantly ignoring the rules and obligations of the road when it's convenient--going the wrong way down one way streets or against traffic, running red lights, zigzagging across the street, riding at night with NO lights and dark clothing, riding on sidewalks, across lawns, and even into buildings (yes, I've seen that in Berkeley).\n\nSo from my perspective, bike riders need to choose--if you want to passionately assert your vehicle rights, you also need to behave within the law like a competent vehicle driver. Two wheel and four wheel--you're all vehicle drivers. So if I'm driving a car and come to a stop at a red light in my car, and wait there until the light changes--don't you come to a full stop as well, then get bored if the light is too long, and run the red light across the intersection when you think it's \"safe\" (I see that every week, sometimes every day, in my neighborhood.)\n\n\\- car drivers know there are many bad drivers, and publicly complain about them all the time. Just visit r/bayarea, where rants about terrible drivers are one of the favorite repeated posts, and each time scores or hundreds of people comment, adding in their own stories of terrible drivers.\n\nBut IMHO cyclists tend to band together, at least in public forums, and minimize or excuse cases of terrible cycling. There have been some horrific high-profile cases of cyclists hitting and killing or seriously injuring pedestrians with reckless behavior (some in Berkeley, and some in San Francisco) and in the responses I've seen, the \"bike community\" is either generally silent, or starts coming up with justifications like *well, maybe the pedestrian wasn't looking*...blaming the victim, essentially. And yes, I know there are many, many more cyclists injured by cars, than pedestrians by cyclists, that's a given--but the response to reckless driving / cycling should be the same when it causes injury or death.\n\nFinally, things may be getting worse with the vast increase in electric bikes. I now regularly see electric bikes going as fast as automobiles--and often  faster--on Berkeley's residential streets. That's going to increase the chances of pedestrians getting hit and killed or seriously injured.\n\nThat's all for now, pause rant.", "id": "k1oafo8", "link_id": "t3_16owhxu", "upvote_count": -1}, {"body": "> public transport here is shit\n\nI\u2019d say it has more to do with shitty city planning.

Berkeley had de-facto housing discrimination--it was *very* prevalent before the 1960s for Berkeley realtors and property owners not to sell to African-American or Asian prospective buyers, and for some of the neighbors to protest on the rare occasions when they did.  But it was not an issue of *\"we're going to create single family home neighborhoods specifically so only white families can live there.\"*  \n\nIn fact, one of the strongest single family home neighborhoods in Berkeley going way back is San Pablo Park, which became the center of Berkeley's African American community. Filled with one story, free-standing, bungalow homes. When Berkeley created some specially zoned single family home neighborhoods (R-1) in the \"flatlands\", one of them was in Westbrae--northwest Berkeley, largely a white neighborhood--and the other was around San Pablo Park, largely an African-American neighborhood.  \n\nDo you know why? Because Berkeley's African American homeowners and civic leaders lobbied the City for single family home zoning for THEIR neighborhood.\n\nJust like \"white neighborhoods\", they were house proud. They wanted to live in a district of low-rise, free-standing homes, owned by their residents. If you look at basically all of Berkeley's early African-American community leaders, they lived in single family homes, and they wanted the same thing for their communities. They did *not* want African-Americans to be relegated to multi-unit neighborhoods, or rental housing.\n\nThis is still the case today. After racial segregation in housing became illegal, a lot of African-American \"inner city\" residents in the Bay Area moved out to suburban areas--the southeastern Oakland Hills, cities like Antioch--which were zoned for single family homes. Same reason as before--there was no difference between the home aspirations of African-Americans and Caucasians.

This is usually when they are crossing at 90 degrees an intersection and both blow through the stop sign without slowing and are surprised that another vehicle (another bicycle in this case) nearly collided with them.", "id": "k1qe4wd", "link_id": "t3_16owhxu", "upvote_count": -1}, {"body": "the elmwood was the first neighborhood in berkeley to be zoned for sfh, and along with that it was a de facto segregated neighborhood because of FHA loans after WWII", "id": "k1o3dzl", "link_id": "t3_16owhxu", "upvote_count": 4}, {"body": "Did I say scooter anywhere?", "id": "k1pjumo", "link_id": "t3_16owhxu", "upvote_count": 5}, {"body": "Yes.

I don't see a reason which the rivarily for the \"top public university\" must be very heated on Reddit, Instagram, IRL, numerous other networks when both universities have a proven prowess unmatched to any other. More importantly and where most people fall short on foresight, both universities attract a entirely different carde of students. The target students in which LA & Berkeley aim to attract have significant differences and it's important to cross-reference them. Here's where both universities shine:\n\n- UCLA: You want to leverage a multidisciplinary liberal arts curriculum, offering numerous majors of global languages, variations of Math, Linguistics, Biology, list goes on, catering to a students specific domain they wish to leverage in the research setting. Have a passion for Acting or Directing? Their school of Television and Theater is tip top. The social scene aims to cultivate a friendly atmosphere beyond the academic setting. First Thursdays lightens up Westwood, a thriving sports culture poised at forging a broader sensation of UCLA as a community. You're the biggest sports faniac out there, enjoys building community within one's social setting, you crave drawing 2 seemingly unusual academic fields together to infer more questions and enrich intellectual knowledge. UCLA particularly thrives and emphasizes all these attributes to nourish it's community with. Many students, of course love the idea of the liberal arts curriculum, socially thriving, they emphasize the need of a balanced college experience, and if that's where their precedence lie, that's great as UCLA offers the richest experience within the context.\n\n- UC Berkeley: The excitement and appetite of learning allures you. Are you interested in learning how to scale Businesses or build your own? How about working alongside the top of the iceberg Chemists? Does Engineering and the corporate setting fit your needs from a college? UC Berkeley particularly thrives at providing a pre-professional setting, praised by a booming market at a stone's throw of Berkeley. It's liberal arts setting is no slouch: you're looking at top Economics, Computer Science, Physics programs. Naturally, a school aimed at providing the deepest learning experiences is academically rigorous. For those students whom may not have a social priority, yet find rigorous learning within the 4-year time frame to be personally rewarding toward their future endeavors: this particular setting isn't for everyone but is for the minds of the intellectually intrigued. Berkeley works you to the bone, and you face the decision of falling under thumbs to the rigor or approaching it under sustainable mindsets and grow as a individual. This is the kind of student Berkeley aims to attract, and that's fantastic for students vying at a setting perhaps not socially pristine, but academically exceptional.\n\nUCLA and UC Berkeley are the greatest universities you can attend. However, the amount of people downplaying a student's decision for choosing one over the other should they have been admitted to both is large, especially on Instagram it seems. A human's proportions of happiness should commonly be respected, and whether their decision to choose a particular college as it's reflective of their own goals is where the decision lies. It's okay to grow your social side. Likewise it's okay to reap the benefits of scaling your learning abilities upwards and challenge yourself rigorously. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem UCLA nor UC Berkeley have an absolute advantage within both scales, causing the particular cross-enroll dilemma. That's where I end by saying: UCLA and UC Berkeley have different student populations. To say its unfair pitting one against another is speaking very lightly. The absurdity of how heated this rivarily is to the point that people take it highly seriously is pointless. Both schools excel in their own rights and both schools are ranked the #1 public universities.

The math isn't too dense, and it's walked through fairly nicely. There's maybe some very very very few parts that have some calculus (basic derivatives/integrations to calculate specific values), but the functions/math are all laid out for you fairly nicely. You can view the course website to get a taste [https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/) (material modeling + simulations have some integrations).

The post-Marxists were all very strong, and Althusser was soon overpowered and escorted to the lectern with his arms twisted. \n\nIn the courtroom, waiting for him, Ranci\u00e8re read out \"May 68 you don't take to the streets, the masses don't need a master teacher to read what you've written for John Lewis\".

Badiou was one of the four kings of Ceres' left wing netizens, so if Althusser pounced on him and injured Badiou, what's wrong with that? Badiou had been in the battlefield for a long time, and did not panic as he coldly watched his teacher Althusser's crazy move. \n\nIn the nick of time, the French and the European Communists on the sidelines reacted quickly and stormed up to tackle Althusser, holding him down for dear life and tying him up.

But I've never met her. I only knew that she had common friends with me. I've seen her before from an online community video chat and I've seen that Facebook recommended her profile to me. She was living in Thailand at the time and moved there for her boyfriend. She was an elementary school teacher, teaching English. Fast forward some years and my best friend said we were picking someone up at the airport. I went with him and his girlfriend to the airport to pick up this stranger and going to dinner together. I was taken by surprise that it was her, the girl that was a friend of my friends that I thought was very attractive. There she was sitting next to me in backseat of the car. She wanted to show off her little trinket to me. She has never been happier, moving back to the US. Apparently, she had recently broke up with her boyfriend because she couldn't see herself living in Thailand for the rest of her life. Even though she did love it, and learned to speak some Thai.  \n\n\nThere was a moment when you just know that she was into you. She does girly things you see on tv. A little bold, yet a little shy. Doesn't want to be too forward verbally but very forward in her body language. She initiated footsies with me when I took her out to lunch another day, by ourselves. That's when she's shuffling her feet under the table and touching yours, either jokingly or in a flirtatious way.  \n\n\nIn another story, a Polish girl who I met on the community video chats thought I was cute. She lived in Atlanta at the time and my cousin's wedding was there a month later. So I DM'ed her and asked if she would be my date. She said yes, but we didn't talk for the entire month leading up to the day. I asked her the day before the wedding and she said she is still interested. She showed up to the church halfway through with her small summer yellow dress and blonde hair. Stunner shades on. Everyone turned around and was wondering what was happening. I waved her over to where I was sitting and we just kind of smiled at each other for a bit until the end of the wedding. With some whispers in between. At the end of the wedding, she surprised my whole family and they had so much questions. She spoke our a few words of our language and won them all over. My aunts can't shut up about her. Unfortunately, she couldn't make it to the dinner party. I didn't see her until the next afternoon, the day before flying home. We end up walking around the neighborhood at night, looked at some unfinished new house and pretended we were buying one and moving in together. It started raining and we walked home drench wet. We sat on the swinging bench in the front porch and watched the stars. A green shooting star flew by and she said, \"Quick, close your eyes and make a wish!\" So I did. I wished to kiss her. We continued talking for a while longer until she stopped me and said, \"Shut up and kiss me already!\" Never before and never again have I ever wished for anything that actually came true. In my mind, I wanted it but too nervous to ask for it but she surprised me with her boldness. I was very attracted to that. Not like I wasn't already before, but now infinitely more. We shared the most wonderful rest of the evening together until sunrise. That was the last I saw of her. We did spoke on the phone about two or three more times until our tethered hearts floated away.  \n\n\nI have a lot more memories like these and each time, the girl would show her interest in different ways. One started a kiss in the hot tub, pressing her body against mine. Weirdly, we were at a beach house Airbnb party that seemingly had no locks and walked in on me taking a number 2 (rofl). I was so taken by surprised, I didn't know if to be embarrassed or what. I took a shower right after and it was as if she was waiting for me to come out, and she did knock and I told her I was showering. When I came out, she came back in the room as I was getting dressed. She said something along the lines of having a surprise for me or a gift. Something happened where my shorts were off and she was giving me head. You can't be any more forward than that. Another girl asked me to stay over after watching several movies at her place. Her bed kept banging the walls with each thrust and she whispered, \"You can fuck me as hard as you want!\" Another girl, this time a Korean, shared some smokes with me. We got high and I wanted to take a shower in the darkness with some music on. I was visiting her from another town. We vibed, talked about her art, and our friends. While I was showering, she had knocked on the door and asked if she could come in. I thought about it for a few seconds, thinking she either needed to use the restroom or something from inside. She came in and closed the door behind her, it was still pitch black. I heard the sound of clothes falling to the ground and she slid the shower door open and came in. She started to press her body from behind me and feeling me with her arms. She whispered, \"Is this okay?\" And my answer?  \n\n\n\\- That's a story for another day.

I get back from Seattle and a week into the semester I get weird symptoms and land in the ICU. Turns out I was in diabetic ketoacidosis and I was very close to going into a diabetic coma. *But I'm not diabetic...* \n\nAs it turns out I have LADA, a rare form of type 1 diabetes that occurs suddenly and randomly (nothing can be done to prevent it) in adults... I'm 25. I spend 5 days in the ICU and another week recovering while I wait for the brain swelling to go down. I have to measure everything that goes into my stomach for carbs now and dose myself with the right amount of insulin *for the rest of my life* (unless I want to go blind and lose a foot when I'm 50 and die at 65), so it'll be a while before I can go out and eat with friends...\n\nOk fine, it could've been worse, I could've had cancer, I could've gotten run over by a semi truck, I'm still alive and I can learn to manage. I tell my parents and they freak out but I have to comfort them and put on a brave face because my mom and dad have health issues of their own, but internally I'm freaking out.\n\n*Ok, the semester isn't over, you can still recover it, it's just 2 techs.* Just when I was starting to feel better and more focused so that I could start studying a little more every day... bam, I get sick with a fucking cold. Feel like total shit, head hurts, no focus. No fever yet, hoping to the fucking cold universe that it isn't COVID...\n\nBy the way, getting sick while having type 1 is a whole other ball game because your body releases hormones while you're sick that *raises your fucking blood sugar to no end*. To make matters worse, high blood sugars hinder your immune system so you're more likely to have an infection spread than if your pancreas didn't just decide to take a random shit on you. Hopefully I can get a hold of my doctor in the morning to ask for advice on what to do. Being diabetic + COVID is fucking precarious since I'm now officially a *high risk cohort* teehee\n\nI have an EECS 126 exam in two days, I'm nowhere near prepared but thankfully the final will clobber it. Sahai 182 is still up in the air... Ok, rant over, I will stop my bitching and get back to trying to understand this fucking homework.

Last year I got a part time job to pay for a car and ended up just focusing on working over school because my whole life up until then I had always though \u201cof course im going to college, most people say that it doesn\u2019t matter where but I know I will go somewhere, get some sort of degree, and then go on with life.\u201d . Towards the end of the year, February, we went on a trip to tour some Colleges up North, Cal being one of them. I fell in love. Its a beautiful campus, and after work being my focus for most of last year, seeing these colleges sort of reignited my drive to learn and look towards my future as something I need to work towards and look forward to, not something that I have to do anyways and I might as well get over with it. Because of that trip being towards the end of the year, it was hard to fix some of my grades and now my senior year is here and I am kind of hard stuck thinking about Cal. My junior grades weren\u2019t the best but were still \u201cabove average\u201d, but I haven\u2019t been in many extra circulars besides 2 sports my years here, and looking at Cal stats it has me very un optimistic for my chances at getting in as a freshman. I of course have been doing a little research for other UCs, and am still going to apply and do my best on essays, but if im going this far planning , planning to go to other colleges has come up. Im sorry for getting this far without a real question im just a little lost right now but wanted to know if i plan to persue an major of aerospace or electrical engineering, and i cant get into Cal as a freshman, would going to a CCC be better than a UC as a transfer. Should I continue looking to get into the best UC, for those majors , that I might be able to get into even if CCC transfers are chosen first, or should I go to a give up on other UC\u2019s and go to a CCC and then apply as a transfer.\n\nI realize this is a lot so for anyone who reads through any input into this would help, and a little TL/DR I guess would be : Should I go to a CCC to \u201cincrease\u201d my chances of getting into Cal as a transfer, or try to get into the bestUC I can get into for what i would like to major in, ie aerospace engineering or electrical engineering, and then try to transfer.

I was far from the best in high school, but like you I was technically \u201cabove average.\u201d I also prioritized work my junior year of high school, so I totally understand the feeling of wishing you focused more on academics. With that being said, my work experience gave me something valuable to write about for my essays, and I personally think that\u2019s what got me into Cal (although I obviously can\u2019t say for certain).

Per standard for college level calculus it is *hard*, but luckily Paulin is probably one of the best professors I've ever had and one of the most understanding/forgiving. He forgave the lowest 2-3 quizzes, the lowest 1-2 hw assignments, and even pushed back the midterm date because of the elections that were happening. \n\n* **TLDR -** Super chill guy teaching a very hard class, though keep in mind this was in COVID so who knows what happened. \n\n`Stat 20: Intro to stats (Ibser)` \\- Stat 20 wasn't particularly hard - it's statistics, and you either love it or hate it. Ibser as a professor seemed like a chill guy irl but was the most disorganized professor I had ever seen. Maybe it was COVID so things got better when it was back in person but OH's weren't really helpful and the homework barely matched what was on the slides. There was R too! But he barely taught us how to use it.\n\n* **TLDR -** It's standard stats, with an assumption you know R (why????), and a professor who's disorganized.\n\n`Econ 2: Intro to Econ (The romers)` *-* They're one of the few econ professor that have good ratings and they're chill! Christina was actually an economic advisor the Obama cabinet (fun fact) and they're like that nice old couple who just wants to help the kids out learn some basic econ to maybe get them interested in the field. From what I've heard it's more intensive than Econ 1, but from what I've heard the romers make it worth it. Do you know how hard it is to make people on the internet say a class that's proven to be harder is worth taking because of the professors? The two vibe a lot (I'd hope they do they're married) and joke around and use their personal anecdotes to illustrated economic concepts.\n\n* **TLDR -** Econ 1 but more in depth with two professors (a couple) who have a cute dynamic teaching. Econ 2 may be harder than Econ 1 materially but the romers make it easier to learn.\n\n`Econ 100A: Micro (Campbell)` *-* He's one of the few econ professors that has stellar ratings and he deserves them. Microeconomics is a tricky subject but he managed to tie it all together by teaching concepts through simplified examples and stories. It's evident he **REALLY** wants you to actually *learn,* which can be a double edged sword: he teaches in a way that's easy to understand and the only real thing you need to do to pass the class is to do the study pack he provides you, but if you want to just bs your way through the class it's not gonna work because he **wants you to learn**. This is evident by the 3 midterms (one the week before deadweek) that are all math and the final which is 2 essays and has nothing to do with the math before. It can be challenging (and I definitely got extremely lucky since the GSI strike wiped out the 3rd mt and made the final graded on completion LOL) but you can honestly get by with a few hours and doing the entire course pack and not going to lecture at all if you wanted to do that\n\n* **TLDR -** A great guy, a great professor, teaching a topic that's challenging. He gives you a course pack which could honestly substitute section, lecture, and OHs if you're really smart, and wants you to learn. By teaching in a very straightforward and simple to understand way, but also giving you 3 mts and a final that's unrelated to all of them\n\n`Econ 100B: Macro (Hawkins)` *-* As with most of the econ professors he seems like a great guy but he is evidently a researcher and not a teacher. I tried to sit through a few of his lectures but almost fell asleep. The GSIs taught better than him and honestly there is no need to go to lecture beyond reading the slides (which is what he does in class) and going to section. He *also* wants you to use excel but *doesn't teach you how to use it* (WHY????). The class content is hard if you're just going from lecture to lecture but if you step back and take a macro (heh) look at the whole course it's very compartmentalized and easy to understand\n\n* **TLDR -** A researcher who's teaching. Almost fell asleep in lecture. Lectures unnecessary go to section instead. Meh difficulty course. He talks like this by the way.\n\n`Econ 140: Econometrics (Faber)` \\- Man what the fuck can he **STOP TALKING SO FAST????** Metrics is a statistics with empirical stuff in R primarily (tho u can use stata or python) but the R instruction is lacking. The homework is graded strictly but the questions are *just vague enough* so it causes confusion and keeps you up 5 hours working with other people as you all argue trying to figure out what it actually wants (true story). GSIs and OHs were helpful though but Faber talks in a way that makes the class harder than it actually is since he talks equations in purely mathematical terms (ie instead of Y = a + beta(xi)+ error he'll say the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variable is affected by a slope coefficient point estimate along with a residual and a constant). Reading that might seem easy to understand but trust me when it gets more complicated and he's talking at 1000mph you're gonna have an experience where you space out for one second and you don't know where in the lecture you are (also true story)\n\n* **TLDR -** Hetalksfastlikereallyfastandtalksinalotofmathetmaticaltermsinfactit'sexactlylikeyou'rereadingthissentenceyouneedtokeepupallthetimeorelseyou'llmisswhathe'stalkingaboutalsowhocantellmewhythepointestimateslopecoefficentthat'sgiventousbyanOLSregressioncouldalsobeafunctionoftheresidualterm and yeah anyways you get my point\n\n**UPPER DIVS (IN PROGRESS or EXPOSED TO):** \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n`Econ 119: Psych and Econ (Taubinsky)` \\- I dropped this class. It's an interesting class but it is **MATHY**. And what's worse is lecture doesn't actually cover how to do the math, it says \"oh the math exists\" and then goes on to cover a lot of irrelevant (but interesting!) examples on the application of Psych and Econ. It's a unique class definitely, I just wish he would actually go over the math in depth. Go to section! The sections help.\n\n* **TLDR -** Interesting mathy class taught by a professor that expects you to do all the math but doesn't actually teach you how to do the math. You must go to section or else you will be perpetually lost\n\n`Econ 121: Industrial Organization + Public Policy (Barahona)` *-* The class I *wish* I could drop. Lectures are NOT RECORDED (WHY????) and it's another mathy class; though unlike Econ 119, it's hard not because he doesn't go into depth on the math, but he goes way too far into depth on math that is not even used so you get confused on what you need to actually know. This is also the first instance where I went to an OH and the GSI **refused to answer questions about the problem set**. Again, sections are important - go to them. They cover problems very similar to the psets\n\n* **TLDR -** Another interesting (mathy) class taught by a professor who expects you to do all the math once you figure out what math you actually need to use (by going to section) out of the super complicated equations he puts on the lecture slides which he doesn't record. Go to section. Don't go to GSI OHs, they don't help.\n\n`Econ 130: Econ and public policy (Lafortune)` \\- Chill guy! Chill class. Barely any math. The one thing is that he takes attendance via iclickr, which uses geopositioning on your device to check whether you're in class or not, and attendance in lecture and section is worth 6% of your grade (if you go to over 50% of them). It's a public policy class so there's a lot more writing than math.\n\n`Econ C110: Game Theory (Kariv)` \\- Chill guy, chill class. Talks slowly, the class goes from 6:30 - 9:30 **PM** this sem (???) but the content seems easy enough. Unfortunately I had to drop this class because of skydeck, but I would've totally stuck with it if I didn't need to.\n\n`Econ 126: China (Roland)` \\- one of the few 3 unit econ upper div classes. Chill professor, chill class. More of a history class than an econ class tbh, which is heaven for people who don't like math (me!) and hell for people who do. There are no sections for this class\n\n**UPPER DIVS (DONE):** \\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n`Econ 139: Asset Pricing and Portfolio management (Bianchi)` \\- Econ 139 is the harder version of Econ 136, but you wouldn't know that unless someone told you (true story). I went into this class thinking it would be something about how assets are priced and managing a well diversified portfolio. Which is what it was - but it's not about how to build and manage your own portfolio, it's about building and managing a theoretical ***everyone's portfolio.*** AKA it's quantative analysis with stochastic calc (calc with time) and risk across time - basically theoretical financial economics and hard microeconomics stuck together which made this by and away **THE HARDEST CLASS I TOOK AT CAL**. If you're good at theoretical math then by all means, but if you're in the majority I say **STAY AWAY** unless you're really really really interested and want to become a quant. Though if you wanted to become a quant you should be a math/stats major... not an econ major. Bianchi's lectures are boring and extremely hard to keep up with because of the scattershot way the content is organized - they're not organized compartmentally and for the first half of the sem we weren't doing anything with asset pricing **OR** portfolio management which made me question why I was in the class in the first place. CAPM appears like halfway through the course. HW is on completion but is unbelievably hard and the mt and final are the same. The one saving grace though is that the curve is **ridiculous**. I'm not sure if it was just my class but at the end of the class he said that everyone who turned in homework would be guaranteed a B in the class no matter how they did because **that's just how lost everyone was**\n\n* **TLDR -** The hardest class I took at Berkeley. It's quantative analysis with a bunch of theoretical financial math and hard microeconomics. Equations everywhere. Equations within equations. Equations within equations within equations. Seemingly no relation between any of the lectures. Everyone is lost - which means that the curve is great. Bianchi guaranteed everyone at least a B- no matter how they did. One of my friends literally got a panic attack and had to leave the final, got a 0, skipped the midterm, submitted all the homeworks: got the B because of the guarantee. It's a mess. You'll get a decent grade because it's a mess, but you'll feel like shit the whole way through\n\n`Econ 155: Urban economics (Nilopa)` \\- The *other* 3 unit econ class that I took. Nilopa was a new professor on tenure (I think) so she might not be teaching it anymore and we might never see her again, but for what it's worth she was on par with Campbell with how she taught the course material (without the 3 mts). Easy to understand, goes to absurd lengths to make sure that the course content is so. And the content isn't particularly hard either\n\n\\-------------------------\n\nSo there you have it.

Courses like Econ 148 (Data Science for Econ), Econ 139 (Asset Pricing and Portfolio Choice), Econ 144 (Empirical Asset Pricing), Econ 165 (Money and Banking), Econ 127 (Antitrust Economics), and Econ 130 (Using Economics for Public Policy) appear to not have existed until 2021/2022. Take advantage of this specialization to take courses you are interested in. \n\n\\- Berkeley Econ also has hired a slew of new professors (and lecturers) since 2020 who will change the future experience of these courses. \\[These new-ish professors are Profs. Valenzuela-Stookey, Semenova, Munoz, Lian, Hermalin, Goldberg, Echenique, Caldwell, Barahona, and Backus\\]\n\n\\- I was able to double major in Economics and Data Science (as the third batch of students ever, before it exploded in popularity and well before CDSS was formed). I don't think this is possible for most future students since there are restrictions on enrolling in high demand majors.\n\n*Stat 20- Intro Stats (Prof. Sanchez), Spring 2017:* This class was not remarkable other than the group of frat guys that showed up drunk to every Friday afternoon lecture. Just basic statistics that you may have seen in AP Stats already. This course just checked a pre-req box. If you can check this box in another way, you should do it with another course. \n\n*Econ 2- Intro Econ (Profs. Romer), Spring 2017:* This course was well taught and should be the intro course you take if you want to major in econ instead of Econ 1. However, both **Profs. Romer** appear to have taken **emeritus status and have retired**. This means that future students won't be able to take Econ 2 or Econ 134 (Macro Policy from the Great Depression to Today) from them. \n\n*Econ 100A- Intro Micro (Prof. Carson), Summer 2017:* I took intro micro after my freshman year. This course was nothing special, just a box to check. I liked the class, I got along well with this professor (who only taught in the summer), but others did not like the course or the professor. **Your mileage may vary.** \n\n*Econ 101B- Intro Macro (Math), Fall 2017 (Prof. Sergeyev):* The more math intensive macro was fine with Math 1A/1B level calculus. I learned a lot about macro and it prepared me well for later macro sequences. This class was curved generously, but don't expect that normally: Prof. Sergeyev was visiting from 2017-18 and went back to his home university (Bocconi in Milan). \\[Side note: This professor was the most fit/jacked prof I have ever seen.\\]\n\n*Econ 121- Industrial Organization, Fall 2018 (Prof. Kawai):* Industrial Organization should be an interesting course since you're trying to understand how economies and businesses are structured. However, this class was BS with this professor. The course was way too easy (except for the Final Exam which was intentionally difficult just to set a curve for the class), you didn't feel like you were learning much, the professor/GSIs didn't seem to be putting in effort \\[one time I went to the prof's office hours and he told me I was the only one who had appeared for the whole semester....\\], and everyone (including the students) were just going through the motions and checking boxes. **Your mileage will be better with a different professor.** Prof. Kawai also appears to be moving back to his native Japan and the University of Tokyo as of Fall 2023, so you may not have to take courses from him in future.\n\n*Econ 136 - Financial Economics, Spring 2018 (Prof. Hawkins):* This was a great course. I took it Spring 2018, and I was engaged the whole time (and it showed with lecture attendance always being high). This is the course you should take from Prof. Hawkins, since he lived it for decades on Wall Street \\[his last job before going to academia was at Countrywide Mortgage running risk management and trading for subprime mortgage debt....before it spectacularly collapsed in 2008\\]. \n\n*Econ 141 - Econometrics (Math), Spring 2018 (Prof. Pouzo):* This is the theoretical/math intensive version of intro to econometrics. You should take it if you have interest in econ research/phd track or if you like math. The course itself was well run and the material was good. Two of my TA's from that class are now rising professors in Europe. (I took this class too early before I took discrete math or any kind of proof-based math and got my ass kicked.)\n\n*Econ C142 - Applied Econometrics, Spring 2020 (Prof. Card):* This course was a masterclass because of who taught it and when I took it (when I had complete mathematical maturity and 3 years of econ under my belt). You will understand econometrics much better after this course and you will actually have powerful tools for applied economic research after this course. However, **Prof. Card** also took **emeritus status** after 2022, so you won't be able to take courses from him. This course also appears to have been replaced with *Econ 143 (Econometrics: Advanced Methods)* as the follow-on econometrics course after 140 or 141. \n\n*Econ 152 - Wage Theory, Spring 2019 (Prof. Walters):* I really enjoyed this course because I was interested in labor markets and how they function. Prof. Walters is also a leading researcher in this area and made the class interesting as well. \n\n*Econ C181 - International Trade, Spring 2018 (Prof. Fally):* If you have an interest in learning how trade works or understanding international economics this is a good place to start. This professor was not the best though in the sense that I didn't find his lectures that engaging and the exams that he wrote were more than a couple of levels harder than what he taught or what you saw in homework. He also accepted this lack of engagement and low lecture attendance, which I did not like. Nice guy, but **your mileage will be better with a different professor.** \n\n*Econ 191 - Economic Research, Fall 2019 (Prof. Eichengreen):* This is the course where you are supposed to write a full-length econ research paper over the course of the semester that can then become your senior honors thesis in your final semester. The lectures themselves are mostly seminars from outside researchers/profs who come and talk about their research and give advice, alongside some crash courses about how to do research/basic programming stuff \\[this may have changed\\]. I enjoyed it because I came up with a cool, researchable idea about labor unions to write about along with a clear empirical strategy, but others struggled because they couldn't come up with a topic. **Your mileage may vary.** \n\nFunny side note: Econ 191 was where I had the most bizarre exam at Cal. The professor asked us to read a bunch of papers from the seminar speakers, himself, and other selected papers, and then take an exam where you would write essays evaluating papers or answer open ended questions from a list that you picked from about the papers or overarching topics. It ended up being farcical because the professor allowed students on exam day to bring in with them an unlimited amount of papers printed out of any kind to use for the exam. What ended up happening is that everyone (including myself) printed out copies of all of the papers verbatim as well as any summaries/notes that we had written about them, or review/commentary/response reports that other people/researchers had written about them. You can imagine what it looked like with people bringing binders/bags/bins full of papers to a lecture hall with \\~100 people in it was like.", "id": "k27s3k7", "link_id": "t3_16s03zd", "upvote_count": 9}, {"body": "I don't think is fair to say that Hawkins just reads the slides.

But I can tell you what I did to get out of that state. two things. Polymathism and purpose. Polymathism allowed me be grateful of the things I have not experienced yet. It is defined as a person of wide-ranging knowledge or learning. Think leonardo da vinci, batman, hannibal, or even sherlock holmes. If all you see is grey then you will be grey. Given I am a physics major and a premed. So I already have a bit of connection to other sciences. But I started to read and discover these new things I didnt even know I had an interest in. I only knew two native languages a year ago, but I saw a video of people speaking german,and I thought why dont i learn german. I maybe drew doodles from time to time when I was a child, but I saw someone draw a portrait of a friend of mine and after taking an interest, in about 4-5 years of practice I have seen more and made more art that I consider to myself as self fulfilling. Now I speak of taking in knowledge from this perspective but the key take away was that I went down a rabbit hole and found something I enjoyed to do or hear or see. Ive experienced more than I ever would have seen in the bubble I call a room. I sat in the grass and felt the wind from time to time. Felt the texture in the tree bark, and breathed in the cold air at 3 in the morning, these were some of the most peaceful times that I have had and try to do it everyday. Feeling my own existence was and is a bit euphoric for me, and Majority of the time I feel happy and glad I can see another day. That second topic was purpose, I believe we choose our purpose. Even if you were built and had the best genetics for a certain sport I still believe whatever you believe is your calling is your calling. I believe I was meant to take in as much knowledge and train myself to be a leader, to care and provide for my family and for my future family. I enjoy helping people, even when I know I need to be a bit more selfish, in the back of my mind I know I would go in a store and buy someone a meal if they asked me for food. No matter how big you believe your purpose to be or how small, go for it because this is your life.\n\n The feeling comes from time to time sure but it usually goes away after a bit. If the feeling comes from your studies, the way I have thought about it was how exhilarating seeing how monumental the tasks were or are. My purpose is to become someone reliable and strong. So that does not just come from my physical strength but my mental as well. I see my studies as a challenge, or a test to see how much I am willing to go, to do what needs to be done. I see it as every assignment,  every exam , and after every grade knowing I did my best I am able to keeping growing as a person.

If you're in the dorms, there should be lounges where your roommate can study so they don't wake you up at night. As for during the day, the good thing is that you have the option of going to the library, the lounge, a friend's place, a cafe, etc., but sometimes you just want to chill at home and I understand why it would be frustrating to have to keep the lights off and be quiet all day.\n\nLast but not least, getting an eyemask and earplugs can help tremendously. I have a housemate who talks on the phone at night sometimes, and buying a [good quality pair of earplugs](https://www.amazon.com/Loop-Quiet-Solstice-Ear-Plugs/dp/B0BT1VH16W/ref=mp_s_a_1_2_sspa?crid=PNNWDQP7D4ON&keywords=loop+earplugs&qid=1695781041&sprefix=loop+earplug%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9waG9uZV9zZWFyY2hfYXRm&psc=1) has really helped me.

Check the City's website for a map of the RPP zones; they extend fairly far out. To park more than two hours (during daytime enforcement) you need a permit which requires proof of residence in the zone. Willard Park is in one of those zones, so that won't work out.\n\nElsewhere in the City, outside the RPP zones, you'll have two parking challenges:\n\n* \\- monthly street sweeping (every block has it), which can be avoided, if you carefully read the signs (red and white);\n* \\- the three day limit (72 hours) on parking in one place. If you're on a residential street, it's quite possible a neighbor will call the police to have your vehicle marked, and then ticketed if it sits there more than 72 hours. You can generally get around this by moving it--even just further down the block, or to the other side of the street--but the situation does exist. \n\nAlso, Berkeley is pretty well parked up, so places to put a truck towing a camper are hard to come by, just because of the sheer length of your rig. You'd need to find a location basically where three adjoining car parking spaces are empty at once. Your range of parking options gets much larger if you go with the van option.\n\nI don't know about the leaving the camper while driving the truck away issue. Interesting question! I guess towed campers come with their own license plates? (I'm not sure).  But I don't know what the California vehicle code or Berkeley regulations say about leaving a vehicle that has no motive power on its own on a public street. It would sort of be like leaving a boat on a trailer parked on the street...not sure. \n\nFinally, be aware that there's a lot of fear / bias in Berkeley (and the Bay Area in general) against vehicle dwellers. They're generally typecast as sketchy, homeless, not-employed, likely to leave garbage piled or strewn on the street, and potential criminals. So at each location you park, you may need to deal with that stereotype. Probably by being very open and friendly with people on the block (telling them you're a Cal student just trying to save money on housing), and by being extremely neat, etc. \n\nThat bias does apply in certain respects, but is not universal.

The girl (we were all drunk btw) who lost her phone started accusing me of being aggressive/sexually coercing her because I kept repeating her name and following her around when I genuinely wanted to give her stupid phone back. \n\nNot all brown girls are like this, again typically those who were born and brought up in the us and then attend top tier schools (Berkeley is top tier on the east coast) act like this.

Location was Dana and Dwight. A car pulled up and two gunmen pointed guns at them. A third guy took all of their stuff and they fled in a dark grey car (he thinks it\u2019s a Kia). My son was super shook and called me from a friends phone. I immediately called the Berkeley police to report the crime. The officer who took the call said this was the 4th armed robbery report in 20 minutes. Two officers then arrived at my son\u2019s location to take the report. During this time, I communicated with my son through his roommate and told him to erase everything from his phone through Find My iPhone. It turns out the robbers did NOT turn off my son\u2019s phone. While the officers were there, they were being notified of more incidents of armed robbery in the area (Berkeley/Oakland/Emeryville). The reported incidents coincided with the route of my son\u2019s phone. Apparently the same gang robbed 10+ people within the hour. The police continued to track my son\u2019s phone and dispatched a ton of police cars, plus a helicopter, and was able to make the arrest. My son and his friend were then taken in the police car to ID the robbers. Thankfully everyone\u2019s safe. And my son was able to get his phone back (but not his credit card, IDs, and backpack). What a horrifying experience! So I went through my emails and looked at all the Berkeley WarnMe messages, and I think that it could be the same people committing all the gunpoint robberies that\u2019s so prevalent at Berkeley these days. The method of robbery and the vehicle descriptions matched. And my son said there was a tote bag at the scene. In any event, just wanted to inform you of what happened tonight.

I disagree that they're a waste of flesh, time , or space. Flash mobbing at some level takes some aspects of intellect. Coordination, Target, and Charismatic ability to persuade. Are there flash mobbers really strangers to each other? They just happen to all do it at the same time. Let's establish something else just because someone is a criminal does not mean they're unintelligent. In fact it's their intelligence which allows them to succeed as criminals. Let's give some examples. Frank Lucas Coffin Trick. Clever way to bypass DEA detection through dead soldier coffins. No one would guess. Rafael Caro Quintero's Marijuana cultivation innovation. Allowed him to grow more and do it in unsuspected desert environments. Jimmy Henchmen and Haitian Jack's connections to drug traffickers. The people who shot Tupac and hated 50 Cent. The question is what to do with them. We have an abundance of talent rotting within prisons and juvenile institutions. The biggest focus today needs to be a way to harness and cultivate it for good. Permanently disenfranchising criminals right to vote and firearms is a poor way to do so. Allowing discrimination which hampers their ability to get well-paying jobs and renting in many locations. This country has an extreme recidivism rate. We don't believe in repaying debt to society. We believe in a form of permanent punishment that extends post incarceration. This leads to desperation and a return to criminality. The vast majority of robbers and petty criminals are financially motivated in their crimes. They have a scarcity of something. Let's equip them with skills in prison to receive gainful employment. Let's not allow discrimination in white collar jobs to incentivize college. College is to most people all about R.O.I. there's no incentive to it if you can't get a job post graduation. Juvenile Probation can be a great way to showcase the punishment aspect but we need to find the carrot. And dangle this carrot and lead these talented but misguided young men to something better. We can't neglect punishment yet it can't extend post-incarceration if we wish for a reintegration to society.

She falls in love with you and you go on your honeymoon and get married? What I\u2019m saying is, a lot of people, especially men, haven\u2019t been taught to understand let alone express their emotions.

They literally expect their feelings to be tended to and reciprocated, without question. \n\nYou got to ask yourself what is likely to happen after you express your feelings. And that will be based off what has happened up until this point. Sounds super obvious but I don\u2019t think the majority of men get this. Ask yourself this, what exactly has been happening between you two up until now? Have you been flirting back and forth?

At UCSB, this is MATH 6A.\n\nLinear algebra (one course). At UCSB, this is MATH 4A.\n\nDifferential equations (one course). At UCSB, this is MATH 4B\n\nGeneral chemistry (full sequence with labs). At UCSB, this is: CHEM 1A-1AL-1B-1BL-1C-1CL.\n\nYou are also required to complete the UC 7 course GE pattern, which you can do at UC Berkeley and receive the GE Reciprocity letter. \n\nComplete the following 7-course pattern by the end of the spring term prior to fall enrollment at UC.\n\n- Two transferable courses in English composition;\n\n-\n-One transferable course in mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning;\n\n-Four transferable college courses chosen from at least two of the following subject areas:\narts and humanities,\nsocial and behavioral sciences,\nphysical and biological sciences\n\nSeveral of the major prep courses will overlap with the GE courses.  \n\nVideo for transfer: https://youtu.be/KOVZ5A2CRHs\n\nSince you are at UC Berkeley, follow the GE requirements needed for your major there and it should fulfill the 7 course GE pattern for transfer.", "id": "k36jm2u", "link_id": "t3_16umop4", "upvote_count": 3}, {"body": "So, genuine question -- why do you want to transfer?

Suggesting to deliberately manipulate her emotionally because you can\u2019t handle that a girl might not like you shows how fragile some of your egos are. Then these are the same people that are shocked that no woman wants to date them, yuck.\n\nSecond off, you gotta chill out, man. If she\u2019s expressed to you that she doesn\u2019t want to kiss right now, then respect that. It\u2019ll hurt, most definitely, but constantly trying to initiate when she already said no comes off as desperate. A lot of ladies like \u201cthe chase.\u201d It\u2019s the uncertain part in the courtship before things are confirmed with a kiss or a text. It\u2019s exciting, it builds romantic tension. Women love the anticipation. \n\nI agree with the comments that say that you should do other things on the side, but do it for you. Being a fleshed out person who doesn\u2019t reveal all aspects of their personality is hot. I suspect that\u2019s why she\u2019s dry as hell in text. She could also be dry in text because she just prefers being in person. The distance creatures desire. Being around each other too much and can make it lose its luster. \n\nShe\u2019s also testing you, seeing if you have the self-confidence to not be so clingy. It\u2019s insecure guys who tend to chase after a girl excessively because they feel like if they aren\u2019t constantly being validated, the girl doesn\u2019t like them. And she literally told you that she\u2019s not friend-zoning you. Idk about you but if a girl slept in my bed and didn\u2019t kiss me I would go crazy!! (good) cuz why would a girl sleep on YOUR bed without kissing you when she\u2019s shown romantic interest in you? She could easily spend that time pursuing another guy - but she won\u2019t, because she has her eye on you.\n\nNow if you don\u2019t like this part, then just disengage. The best way would be to just respond less and less. Ghosting for the sake of her attention is fucked up and not a genuine way to get a girl\u2019s interest. It\u2019s manipulative, the little bitch way out. if you truly feel that ghosting her would be better for your well-being, then go for it. I personally wouldn\u2019t because it seems like there\u2019s great potential here, but as I learned last week, a lot of guys just don\u2019t enjoy building up romantic tension in a way that girls enjoy. \n\nTLDR: respect her boundaries, let her initiate things, and become more engaged with your hobbies which will make you seem multifaceted. If you don\u2019t like whatever is going on slowly emotionally detach from her, if she asks what\u2019s going on just tell her the truth.

If she cares about how you feel and knows how you feel towards her, she shouldn\u2019t keep you waiting.

If you're just randomly visiting Berkeley in the summer season (and not part of a planned program) it's gonna suck. Berkeley is dead in the summer when most students are gone and is pretty boring, but commuting and getting around is much easier in the summer because there's so much less people. In the summer San Francisco is a better visit. During the fall especially when football season starts, Berkeley becomes more active because the sport brings in all sorts of visitors and businesses. The fall is also when Berkeley's academic programs and research programs do a lot more events and other things. San Francisco is still great to visit in the fall (especially if you're over 21 and seeking nightlife stuff). But either cities, if you're visiting requires a lot of planning to make it enjoyable.

I have not explored a lot of these libraries in much depth, so much of my opinions might be misinformed.\n\nNote: I use \"desks\" and \"tables\" interchangeably.  I'm sorry.\n\nHonorable Mention: Free book collection on floor 2 of the Social Sciences building: No desks/chairs, but it's a nice open space. Open when most other spots are closed, which is nice.\n\n15. Physics/Astro Library: Big tables, and hours aren't that bad, but it doesn't have any books. It feels sad. :(\n\n14. French Library (\"Library of French Thought\"): Pretty terrible hours (10-1 Mo/We, 12-4 Tu/Th), has a decent amount of books and a nontrivial amount of books that are in English (they are about France). Good big tables, though it's a really small library so not that many of them. There's some stacks that only people who are taking French 4 or higher can browse, but I don't hold that against them in this case because those would be the only folks who'd want to see those books since they're probably in difficult-to-understand French. It's in Dwinelle on floor D, so that's a big plus, though as study spaces in Dwinelle go I prefer the Common Grounds formerly-a-cafe because of actually dependable hours and capacity (the French library has very few tables).\n\n13. Doe Library (minus the parts which have separate hours): Hours are good; closed Saturdays and opens late on Sundays though. (though this is a thing with most libraries). Pretty bad book density, so not that interesting to lurk, wide hallways and the aesthetic exacerbate this, makes it feel \"empty\" or \"soulless\" in a way. A lot of the hallways feel like the backrooms and the layout's confusing and nontrivial. There are bathrooms but they aren't that nice and they're nontrivial to find (no big blue signs saying \"restroom\" and very few maps on walls (this also makes it difficult to find other things). Even though there's signs pointing to stuff, they're few and far between, so you could easily make a wrong turn before the next sign. It took me at *least* a half-hour to find the Bancroft library for my first time. And being lost isn't that fun because there aren't just random books around you everywhere. Whoever said Dwinelle was a \"freshman maze\" hasn't been to Doe Library.  Heyns's not a bad place to study. North would be cool but they don't let us go inside to preserve its \"historic character\" (and so we can only look through the doorway). I guess we all have different priorities Note that this categorization is kinda unfair to Doe because this entry is basically \"Doe minus all the good parts\" and the good parts all come separately.\n\n13. Moffitt: One of the best hours around (Open on Saturdays!!!), first and fifth floors are pretty nice study spaces but get packed. Lots of natural light on 4th and 5th floor. 1st floor has nice aesthetic too, (the wood-y walls are pretty!) Floors 4-5 crowded in general, lots more couches than desks and most of the stuff are in reservable rooms so imo not that easy to find study space on those floors. Why are there couches if there's no books to read on the couches? Oh, what James Moffitt would think after the book collection named after him (see 3rd floor plaque) has dwindled down to two dictionaries and a 15-or-so-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica. (I do not count the books in moffitt circ because those books have a home somewhere else, and you can't browse them from Moffitt.)\n\n12. Bancroft: Bancroft's weird. It has a lot of cool materials but there's a big process in order to get to use them. It isn't as bad as it looks. You look at an item on the library catalogue, you sign up for the portal, and then you request it. What I hold against Bancroft is that the language it uses feels \"gatekeepy.\" Users of the library should be \"researchers.\" If you're making an account for the item-request portal, it asks for your purpose of research, and there is no option that says \"personal interest\" or anything of the like. Note: I asked the staff about this and they didn't seem to care if I'm an actual researcher; I think they said to lie and pick \"research paper\" for the \"purpose of research\" thing. Looks like nobody actually checks that a research paper comes out. Hope they could change that though. There's a lot of really cool historic stuff that you can request though. You can't borrow them though (they're usually rare stuff, so that's prob for good reason), and you can bring very few stuff in (which is annoying, especially if your backpack doesn't fit in the lockers and/or if you just want to browse stuff in the reading room (a collection of reference books that you don't have to request). They have immaculate bathrooms though.\n\n11. Institute of Government Studies Library: Hours aren't that bad, reading room has quite a lot of tables, they're the small round desks though, so not as good if you have a lot of stuff to lay on the desk. Reading room has some periodicals and cool books, probably really cool to reference. Most of their stacks are closed though, they're only open when circ staff are working, which is only in the afternoons.\n\n10. Hass Library: I haven't explored this one much, especially not the actual materials, so its ranking is kinda nebulous. It's a quite pretty space, which is nice. Hours are really good (open Sunday mornings!!), lots of tables to study. In the Hass school of business so kinda out of the way.\n\n9. Ethnic Studies Library: Hours aren't that bad, Right next to Institute of Government Studies library but it has open stacks which you could just browse so it goes on top. Doesn't have that many trash cans though.\n\n8. College of Environmental Design library: Pretty big library; lots of tables but they're usually all packed. Hours are decent, there's some pretty cool folios and double folios, stacks are browsable and pretty awesome as well. Library's quite pretty, it feels like there's lots of light, not sure why. Hours aren't bad, opening at 9 a.m. is nice.\n\n7. Newspapers and Microforms room: It's a really big room, idk what's up with that, but it's kinda cool. There's rows upon rows of documents and laws and newspapers and stuff all preserved onto microfilm and you could just take them out and view them on a reader. I'm not much of a history person. If I were, this would be higher. Horrible hours though: Weekdays 1-4 p.m. \n\n6. Evans library: Lots of natural lighting, good hours, in Evans Hall (I spend a lot of time there; I can't really understand what's in the shelves (with a few exceptions) because they're really advanced math stuff. It's really nice being there at the carrells by the window when the sun sets and the light starts turning orange. Currently holds the physics/astro collection.\n\n5. Morrisson Library: Pretty unique because it's a \"no laptop space,\" which I like a lot because I could actually get some reading done for once. I treat it as an electronics-free space, which makes it even better. Lots of cool fiction there, I haven't browsed it much so I'm not sure how browsable it is. Furniture's comfortable. Good for reading. Aesthetic's nice too. Hours aren't bad (opening at 10 is nice) but not that good either (closing at 4 isn't that good)\n\n4. East Asian Library: In my opinion the prettiest library on campus. I don't understand any East Asian languages, so I'm not sure how much I'd use it, but it's a really nice space, lots of light and stuff. Lots of greenery to its north as well!\n\n3. VLSB library: Relatively big library, spacious, lots of shelves, lots of accessible and interesting texts, quite a few tables (usually there's a spot open), a couple couches, lots of light, nice reference material near the front -- useful for a lot of things, and some of them are just interesting, like the one about cool maps. Good hours too, closes at NINE!\n\n2. Main (Gardner) Stacks: Glorious collection of inconcievably-many books. It has the most specific stuff, there's books that are the censuses of a particular year, or the results of a particular conference, or an overview of a really niche combination of subjects, or something else entirely, and then there's the triple and double folios. Just so many awesome books everywhere. It's so fun to just lurk around and see what sort of books are around the corner! Downside: The fiction section isn't shelved in the most browser-friendly manner. It's organized in the library of congress system so it's by author's name more than genre or anything. If you want to visit on a saturday or a morning and you're not a UCB student, it's kinda annoying because you'd need to fill up the form a long time beforehand. Hours are VERY good; if they weren't good I'd be concerned. It feels like it has the soul of a hundred libraries, though a lot of the libraries which feel soulless (and bookless) have had their souls sucked into here and idk whether that's a good thing or not.\n\n1. Earth Science and Map Library. This place is really nice to poke around in, there's drawers full of maps; all sorts, from topos to aerial photos, to road maps, to geologic maps, to bus system maps, and a lot more stuff I haven't seen yet. There's also microfilms of the Sanborn maps, which are these really detailed \"fire insurance maps\" which give you really detailed snapshots of how a city was like in the 20th century. (really detailed building maps with building purposes) The organization might be a little intimidating, but the staff are really friendly and will help you out! I just really like maps! Hours aren't that good though, 11-5 isn't ideal, and I feel like it isn't the best of a study space (in my opinion), but that's probably just because its materials are so cool!! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaven't visited: Music Library, BAMPFA, BerkeleyLaw Library, Chemistry Library, S/SE Asian library, Institute Transportation Studies library, LBNL library, Haviland Hall library, Kresge (closed), Philo library (temporarily closed), Anthro library (temporarily closed), Rhetoric/Film library (grad students only), Comparative Literature library, Italian/Scandinavian library, History Grad library (prolly grad students only, considering the name), Art History Library (i *think* grad students only? not sure), prob some other stuff I'm forgetting, prob some other stuff I don't know about yet", "upvote_count": 1, "id": "16vh8zw", "comments": [{"body": "Wait, they don't let you go into the North Reading Room in Doe anymore?

You can only look in?\n\nThird: some responses to some of your commentary:\n\n\\- The *Library of French Thought* was a gift to the University in World War I. The French government put together comprehensive book collections documenting the intellectual history of France and sent them abroad, in part because there was legitimate fear that Germany would overrun France and submerge / obliterate French culture. But now, well over a century after that fraught moment, it's still a good artifact of a big part of western intellectual history.\n\n\\- *Newspaper / Microfilm* room is so large (and tall) because it occupies the shell where the Main Stacks once stood. In that volume there were hundreds of thousands of books on several levels of really tight / narrow book stacks with glass block floors, that were entered from the Heyns Room. Little metal staircases everywhere, and study desks that grad students could reserve tucked in amongst the books. When the current Main Stacks were built, all the books were moved to it, and the old stacks demolished, leaving Doe with a big, hollow, core. \n\nGoing back even further on the Main Stack history--before Doe was built, college and university libraries (and most big public libraries) had separate rooms / buildings for separate collections. Berkeley did have the Bacon Library, which was one space, but it was also thematically divided up. So people naturally thought, oh, English literature, that should have a room of its own next to the English Department offices. The design of Doe pioneered a new concept--put ALL (or almost all) of the books in one unified collection / storage area, with one staff. The alternative would have been a library building the same size, but filled with separate, self-contained, rooms each with its own specialized collection. Doe was the forerunner of huge central university libraries like this all over the United States. So your impression of the *\"soul of a hundred libraries sucked in here...\"* is more true than you might have imagined. (Also, many faculty, alumni, and private collectors over the past 150 years have given their private book collections to the University, and many of those books have ended up in the Main Stacks. So when you're browsing, take a look at the book plates / inscriptions on the title pages or inside front covers. You'll find ghostly pieces of literary history there.)\n\n\\- *Morrison Library:* specifically built and operated as a recreational / relaxation library for students. Not intended for studying, but as more of a restful space for students, and designed to be like the library of a big, private, home. Hence the design, comfortable chairs, couches, lamps, artwork. You should check out the monthly lunchtime poetry readings there, as well. \n\n\\- Bancroft Library: was indeed specifically created for research purposes. And so many of the materials are so fragile--quite a lot of them are unique--that the library doesn't want people handling them directly unless there's a very specific purpose, like it's someone's handwritten journal and the researcher is writing a book on that person.  The Bancroft has some interesting sub collections--like the University Archives, which is the official repository of campus and Office of the President records. Take a look at their website sometime, for all the special collections they house--going back to Egyptian papyrus scrolls, and ancient European maps / books. Also, a lot of the things held in the Bancroft collections are stored at the Northern Regional Library (see below) so the process of calling things up and bringing them to campus does need advance notice.\n\n*- Confusion getting around Doe / Bancroft.* Doe was built first, starting in the 1910s. It had a pretty coherent design and layout--basically a huge, hollow, square. It was built in stages, though. Bancroft built next, in the 1940s or 50s, and was attached to Doe, but operated as a separate building. The only entrance to the Bancroft Library was from the Campanile side--you couldn't go from Bancroft to Doe without going up and down obscure staircases (worse than today, I'm told). When the Bancroft was completely gutted and renovated several years ago, it was intentionally connected to Doe by that cross-corridor with the display cases in it. But the Bancroft Library access still feels obscure--you walk through that corridor, and you sort of have to know in advance that the student sitting at that desk on the south side is the face of the gateway to the Reading Room upstairs. \n\nI do agree it would be nice if you could go in and browse through the collections in the outer area (yearbooks, campus directories, etc) without the whole sign-in / bag-check process, though.  \n\nShould add to your list to explore: **northern regional library** at the Richmond Field Station. You take a shuttle bus out there. A lot of campus collections have their overflow stored there. Every several years the University builds another extension to that building. It also, I think, serves the Davis and Santa Cruz campuses as well (thus, \"regional\" in the title). **Berkeley Public Library** (an impressive Central Library in Downtown Berkeley at Kittredge and Shattuck, and four branches elsewhere in the city). Anyone can get a library card there, you don't have to be a Berkeley resident. **Graduate Theological Union Library** on Ridge Road, a block north of the campus. The GTU is a consortium of most of the religious schools in Berkeley. They originally had their separate libraries, but in the 70s they agreed to build one unified library, and put all their research / reference collections there.

Probably they do appreciate an inquiry in advance so they can get things ready.\n\n**Bookplates.** So, since the 1700s at least--especially back when when printed books were rare / expensive--many people would personalize them with a bookplate. Which is basically a paper card with the name of the owner, and often something like a drawing or a motto or favorite saying. Many became very elaborate. These would be glued inside the front cover of the book, so it could always be identified as belonging to that person's collection. A personalized bookplate would have the owner's name printed as part of the design. But you could also buy generic bookplates with an empty box or space to write in your name.\n\nSee: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex\\_Libris\\_(bookplate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_Libris_(bookplate))\n\nWhen people died, or gave their libraries away, the bookplates would typically remain in the books since they were glued in place. A lot of personal libraries were given to UC by alumni, rich donors, or faculty so scattered throughout the library collections you'll find books with bookplates. So I was just suggesting that if you're looking at an older book in the Stacks, or elsewhere, also look at the inside front cover and see if it has a bookplate that would give a clue as to where it came from.  The UC Library itself also once used to use bookplates with the UC seal: See: [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Book\\_plate,\\_University\\_of\\_California,\\_MDCCCLXVIII\\_%281868%29,\\_FIAT\\_LUX,\\_Ex\\_Libris,\\_BHL23731638\\_%28cropped%29.jpg](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Book_plate,_University_of_California,_MDCCCLXVIII_%281868%29,_FIAT_LUX,_Ex_Libris,_BHL23731638_%28cropped%29.jpg)\n\nBookplates often include the Latin phrase, \"Ex Libris\", meaning *\"from the library of...\"* or *\"a book belonging to...\"*\n\nHaving bookplates also helped if you loaned someone a book and they \"forgot\" to return it. The bookplate would be evidence that it was your book when you visited their home and found it. :-) \n\nOn the Bancroft yes, definitely the staff want people to use the materials. But since so many of the items are fragile or one of a kind, they do have a lot of rules for use on some things (cotton gloves, etc.). I didn't mean to say they didn't want people to research there, they do, but they are hyper focused on everything being preserved.\n\nI don't know about other Dwinelle libraries, unfortunately.", "id": "k2w1bao", "link_id": "t3_16vh8zw", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "Yeah I did what you\u2019re doing rn during freshman year, and although I will not spoil anything, it\u2019s good to know before hand prior to walking from one end of the camps to another.", "id": "k2rockg", "link_id": "t3_16vh8zw", "upvote_count": 2}, {"body": "found it, thanks friend", "id": "k2s1qg9", "link_id": "t3_16vh8zw", "upvote_count": 2}, {"body": ">you\u2019re not a visitor\n\nWhat am I, if not a visitor everywhere I go?", "id": "k2so2kt", "link_id": "t3_16vh8zw", "upvote_count": 3}, {"body": ">That sign is for tourists to not go in and disturb students studying as the library is open to the public. \n\nThis is weird.

If anything the posts here have convinced me otherwise.", "id": "k2w4r25", "link_id": "t3_16w1ldp", "upvote_count": -19}, {"body": "First off, I've never been a member of Thrive. However, I have several close friends who have been in it, and their experiences have given me insight into what Thrive is really about. Not only have I spoken extensively with them, but I've also been to one of their Bible study sessions. From my observation, it was just a gathering of young people, exploring their faith, sharing their thoughts, and supporting each other. It was, in a word, chill.\n\nNow, let's address the elephant in the room: the supposed 'secret tithing'. Here's the scoop: it's completely optional. I've been to plenty of other clubs and organizations where donations or contributions are encouraged but not mandated. From my understanding, this isn't any different.\n\nYes, I've heard that there are dues that members who are connected to the national organization pay. However, let's put things in perspective. College is expensive. We pay exorbitant amounts for textbooks, meal plans, housing, and so much more. Compared to these expenses, the dues for Thrive are a drop in the bucket. And if you take into consideration the community, support, leadership opportunities, and personal growth that Thrive offers its members, it's more of an investment than an expense.\n\nIn my interactions and observations, the members of Thrive seem genuine in their mission and are passionate about their faith and community. It's easy to get caught up in rumors and half-truths, but it's essential to approach things with an open mind and not jump to conclusions based on hearsay.\n\nI felt the need to share this because, in a time where misunderstandings can spread like wildfire, it's essential to have balanced perspectives. Thrive, like any other organization, is made up of individuals, each with their stories, hopes, and beliefs. Let's give them the space and respect to express those without prejudice.", "id": "k2vv8v7", "link_id": "t3_16w1ldp", "upvote_count": -38}, {"body": "Throwaway account here.\n\nHaving once been deeply involved with Thrive, I feel an overwhelming need to address some of the misconceptions and rumors that have been circulating. My time there was genuinely enlightening, filled with love and fellowship, and I can state unequivocally that it is not a cult, not even a little bit. \n\nTo begin with the matter of tithing which ppl are saying is shady: it's a voluntary act of faith and devotion. Yes, members of the Inner Circle are required to tithe, but The Inner Circle is made up of the most humble and dedicated servants of God, and their commitment to tithing is just an expression of their unwavering faith. For most members, tithing is completely optional, demonstrating the organization's respect for individual choices.\n\nIt's essential to note that Thrive places a high value on financial responsibility. Even those deeply devoted members of the Inner Circle are bound by rules that prevent them from using financial aid for tithing. Only if they can exhibit stable financial resources are they permitted to tithe in this manner. The integrity of Thrive in these matters is unwavering, ensuring that no member's financial well-being is jeopardized.\n\nIn relation to the completely false claims against Pastor Kevin, clarity is vital. It's been troubling to see his name tarnished. The accusations came from three women who weren't even affiliated with our community. And the legal system, a pillar of our society, found their testimonies lacking credibility and Thrive has opted not to pursue legal action or libel suits against these women even though it is well within their rights to do so. \n\nRegarding the ridiculous claims that members, particularly those from the Inner Circle, face undue pressure when contemplating departure: Perspective is paramount. If a family member like a mother thought of stepping away from her children, isn't it natural that concern and love would manifest as a plea for reconsideration?\n\nLastly, every member of Thrive has the autonomy to depart when they feel called to do so. My own journey is a testament to that. Though I'm no longer a part of Thrive, the memories, the lessons, and the love I experienced there still resonate deeply within me.
