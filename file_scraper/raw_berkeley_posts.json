I imagine it'd be relevant again here. I didn't distinguish between which places offer by the slice although in certain places I have noted it and it'll include some places that are further out from downtown:\n\n* Cheeseboard and/or Sliver - Examples of sourdough crust, \"California\" style pizza. Daily rotating pizzas but they only offer cheese + vegetarian options (no meat toppings ever) but I wouldn't let that turn you off to it if you usually get meat toppings. Try it with the green sauce. Walking distance from campus and probably the most \"unique\" pizza to the area. Sells by slice or whole. Cheeseboard is the OG and probably a little better but Sliver is closer. Like I said previously I think the move here is to see what pizza is offered the day you'll be going (I think they update their schedules at the start of each week) and make the choice based on that. If you're elsewhere in the Bay you might end up near an Arizmendi bakery which is part of the same collective as Cheeseboard and also offers the same style of pizza (again with different daily toppings).\n\n* Arinell's - By-the-slice NY Style pizza right next to campus. Cheaper side of things.\n\n* Jupiter's - Beer garden near campus with pizza. I never thought their pizza stood out but they have a good ambiance and it's a great place to hang out and get beers also. Might get quite crowded depending on when you go.\n\n*    Pizzeria de Laura - Newer place near campus. Opened by a 3x pizza champion. They offer NY, Sicilian, Detroit, and Grandma style pizza. Whole pie restaurant (I think). I've been myself and they are great. The Sicilian and Detroit were both fantastic and I'd like to try all their styles. Haven't had by the slice from them though.\n\n*    Rose Pizzeria - Walking distance, more of a sit-down place that's higher priced. Whole pizzas only. NY/Neapolitan style.\n\n*    Emilia's Pizzeria - Long walk/driving/rideshare distance. This is a unique entry in that it's a one man operation. You have to order online ahead of time for pickup only and it's whole pies only. I'll admit this may not be the most feasible thing to get while visiting (as opposed to for locals who might order and bring home), but it's good NY style pizza. (https://emiliaspizzeria.com/)\n\n*    Tap in Lounge and/or Curry Pizza House - I'm not sure if Indian Pizza (pizza with Indian flavors and toppings like Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, etc.) is just a Bay Area trend or a food trend that's spreading everywhere, but here are two closest examples of places near Berkeley that offer it. If it's indeed just a Bay Area trend maybe worth checking out for uniqueness. If you like fusion and Indian you should like it. The first place I was aware of to do this is Namaste Pizza, but they're more driving/rideshare distance from campus and only do whole pies. I think the other places I mentioned would offer slices.\n\n*    Gioia's - Driving/Rideshare distance from campus, but IMO some of the best NY style pizza in the Bay. Offered by slice or whole.\n\n*    Zachary's - Driving/Rideshare distance from Berkeley but this is an example of our local take on Chicago deep dish.\n\n*    Rotten City Pizza - Driving/Rideshare distance since it's actually in nearby Emeryville, but this is also another favorite local NY-style place with pizza by the slice or whole. Not sure I'd make the trip out here just to get this pizza but maybe it'll be nearby depending on where you stay or other places you go.  \n  \n\n**NOT PERSONALLY RECOMMENDED BUT WELL KNOWN OR NEARBY:**\n\n*    Blondie's Pizza - It's popular with students but I honestly don't think their pizza is that great. I think it has location, price, and history going for it but I don't actually think the pizza stands out.  \n\n*    Artichoke Basille - Near campus, but this is an extension of a NY store. So I don't think of it as really a local spot. Pizza's not bad and the artichoke one actually kinda reminds me of chowder on a pizza. But I prefer the other NY style places I mentioned. But I do think it's better than Blondie's.  \n\n*    Seniore's Pizza - Cheap pizza near campus but nothing special. If you're opting for cheap and super close to campus either Blondie's or Artichoke would be better.  \n\n*    Gypsy's Trattoria - This is near campus in Asian Ghetto (another nickname) and a student dining stalwart. Used to get their calzones all the time when I went there especially the pesto chicken calzone. Don't know if it really holds up but as a student it was a lot of food at a pretty good price. Big enough to serve in those pink takeaway cake boxes.  \n\n*    West Coast Pizza - It's near campus and basically it's main reputation is that it's cheap and I think it ran deals and people kinda like the cheesesticks but I wouldn't go here.  \n\n*    North Beach Pizza, Bobby G's, Red Tomato - I'm aware that these three places are also in Berkeley and nearish to campus but I can't recommend if only because I actually haven't gone there myself nor heard any kind of associated buzz about them. So even if they've been around for a while now I haven't been motivated to check them out vs. places I do already know about or a newer place like Pizzeria de Laura.", "upvotes": 14}, {"body": "*Cheese Board is the original.\n*Arizmendi serves pizza authorized by CB\n**Sliver, unauthorized!", "upvotes": 0}]}, {"title": "can math 56 satisfy applied math degree?", "upvotes": 1, "created_utc": 1698454425.0, "id": "17i295p", "body": "", "comments": [{"body": "You need the differential equations", "upvotes": 1}, {"body": "Yes", "upvotes": 1}, {"body": "Yes, but a lot of upper divs require 54 and 55 for mathematical maturity but if you got it the prerequisite are not enforced", "upvotes": 1}]}, {"title": "Late change in schedule petition", "upvotes": 1, "created_utc": 1698450992.0, "id": "17i14yd", "body": "How likely would my petition to drop a class be approved.

Try art classes, go to co-op parties, strike up small talk with folks waiting in a line, join a poetry club, pretty much try out events that involves people even if that event isn't usually your thing (turns out I actually really really like art and poetry after trying my hand at both of them!). Speaking as someone that pretty much didn't have actual friends before college and thus my social skills sucked ass, it really boils down to how much effort you want to invest in getting good at socializing (beyond small talk, that typically involves taking more social risks, patience, and being vulnerable. I failed a bunch of times initially and weirded out some folks, it's a skill tho and you eventually get better at it if you're consistent). Just keep trying new stuff and be patient, take more risks that can make you look stupid and eventually people will start to flock towards you.\n\nUnrelated to social stuff, I wish I didn't pigeonhole myself so much to what I thought I was/should do. I did eecs and tried to stay engaged in the tech world afterwards but it turns out it's more of an interest than a career I'm happy with \ud83d\ude02 now I'm pursuing electrician stuff while doing odd jobs to get more clarity. I may not be making bank but I feel more alive and free, and honestly that's really what I care the most about nowadays. Maybe the electrician stuff won't work out either, I can try nursing next, regardless I'm getting a clearer idea of what I want by realizing what I don't want, something I wouldn't have achieved if I didn't take risks/stayed in my comfort zone. If you're trying to do the \"right things\" to make friends then you're still trying to stay in your comfort zone by following a plan; introduce some more spontaneity so that you're not sure if it's the right thing, find people that aren't sure either and suddenly you have a good reason for a camaraderie to flourish in this mess we call life \ud83e\udd23 you can also keep doing the \"right things\" and maybe you'll eventually have success...but personally my two closest friends were made unintentionally (one was by getting blackout drunk and vomiting twice in our room since we were roommates, that led to a chain of events where we eventually became friends. The other happened during an event for transfers, I was super into this one girl and she wasn't into me so I knocked on this one dude's dorm door that I barely knew with snot and tears running down my face because I felt he was someone I could talk to. Even then we didn't click until 2ish years later where we shared some mutual friends and started hanging out more often). Just keep trying, shake things up a bit, try new strategies if old ones don't work, dare to look stupid, etc", "upvotes": 10}]}, {"title": "Cornerstone is having free comedy tonight.", "upvotes": 7, "created_utc": 1698333281.0, "id": "17gyrxd", "body": "Starts at 8:30, it\u2019s free.", "comments": []}, {"title": "Shit my pants in class, you think my crush noticed?", "upvotes": 0, "created_utc": 1698327286.0, "id": "17gwo34", "body": "Hey.

Del Valle\u2019s colleague thought he\u2019d be a good fit for an event they were planning on the student and worker uprisings of 1968 in Mexico and elsewhere around the world.After the presentation, del Valle, a tenured associate professor of colonial studies in Berkeley\u2019s department of Spanish and Portuguese, approached him and suggested they get together to talk about the conference. Clover agreed, and two weeks later, they met at the Prizefighter Bar at the northwest tip of Oakland. She had beer; he had wine.\n\nClover would later tell investigators he felt \u201cuncomfortable with the interaction\u201d with del Valle and ended the conversation early. She began talking as though the meeting were a date, he said, and became \u201cvisibly flustered\u201d when he mentioned his partner. Del Valle remembered it differently. She considered it a social meeting with a colleague, she said, and she\u2019d suggested wrapping it up because Clover had said he had a reading group to join afterward.From there, things went rapidly downhill.Del Valle, who had been following Clover for a few months on Twitter before they met, thought afterward that he was obliquely insulting a few of her colleagues on the platform without naming them. He was becoming irritated with what he described as \u201cconfusing\u201d messages she was sending him privately about how someone was bothering her.\n\nThe dispute, which has jolted the lives and careers of two scholars highly respected in their fields, began where so many of higher-education\u2019s fiercest fights have been waged, on the platform formerly known as Twitter. There, del Valle became convinced that tweets from Clover\u2019s account, and another one she felt was associated with the professor, were delivering a series of coded \u2014 and deeply personal \u2014 taunts. By the time the dispute spiraled off the computer screen, del Valle was delivering messages instead in silver spray paint and mashed pineapple.The events that followed raise difficult questions. Among them: At a time when much of academic culture is lived on social media, where identities can be masked and threats veiled, how does a university respond to a professor\u2019s seemingly far-fetched allegations about what happens there?The Chronicle has pieced together the following account based on extensive interviews with del Valle, hundreds of pages of documents, including letters, correspondences, and screenshots she shared, along with reports Clover provided from three Title IX investigations. Del Valle\u2019s supporters have also offered testimonies from 48 current and former students, many of whom spoke with The Chronicle, about the professor\u2019s contributions as a mentor and scholar. Efforts to reach Clover\u2019s supporters were less successful, since he hasn\u2019t been speaking publicly about the dispute. The Chronicle reached out to several of his colleagues in the English department at Davis, as well as to a few supporters who weighed in on social media. The only one who responded referred the email to the university\u2019s public-relations office.\n\nWhen del Valle first approached The Chronicle in late August to urge a reporter to look into her case, she declined to identify the person she accused of hacking her phone and laptop and electronically stalking her. She identified him only as a professor at another University of California campus. The Chronicle later identified him as Joshua Clover.A tenured professor with appointments in English and comparative literature, Clover is well known in literary circles as a poet, columnist, and political theorist who directs the university\u2019s Marxist Institute for Research.

The only one who responded referred the email to the university\u2019s public-relations office.\n\nWhen del Valle first approached The Chronicle in late August to urge a reporter to look into her case, she declined to identify the person she accused of hacking her phone and laptop and electronically stalking her. She identified him only as a professor at another University of California campus. The Chronicle later identified him as Joshua Clover.\n\nA tenured professor with appointments in English and comparative literature, Clover is well known in literary circles as a poet, columnist, and political theorist who directs the university\u2019s Marxist Institute for Research. Del Valle is also well known in her field, as an expert in colonial Latin American studies and as a mentor to students who, like herself, are immigrants and the first in their families to attend college.\n\nUC-Berkeley\u2019s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination conducted three separate Title IX investigations on the case \u2014 in 2019, 2021, and 2022. All found that she had either harassed Clover or violated orders not to contact him. Del Valle is on paid administrative leave, banned from teaching, advising, and entering nonpublic parts of the campus. Clover told The Chronicle that Berkeley\u2019s interim Title IX officer has said Clover is not prohibited from sharing the reports from those investigations. He confirmed that he was the complainant but declined to comment further for this article.\n\nIn an email to a handful of del Valle\u2019s supporters, he wrote that the charges included \u201cmultiple instances of stalking, sexual harassment, retaliation, and violation of no-contact directives directed against me, my family, and my students; many many charges across many many years.\u201d\n\nDel Valle said that, to the contrary, she\u2019s the victim of sexual harassment by Clover. None of the investigations found evidence that Clover had stalked or harassed del Valle. She contends that\u2019s because the university never gave her complaints the attention they did Clover\u2019s, or fulfilled her request to perform a forensic evaluation of her phone and laptop to see if they\u2019d been hacked.\n\nThat her university is punishing her as a harasser is \u201can ironic reversal of the reasons for which Title IX regulations were created,\u201d she wrote in notes she prepared to explain her side of what would become a tangled, yearslong dispute. \u201cNot a single thing I have done or supposedly done is romantic or sexual in nature. The opposite is true. They have all been defense against humiliating abuse and sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nJanet Gilmore, a campus spokeswoman, said privacy policies prevent her from discussing the specific complaints. As a campus, she added, Berkeley is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that individuals are treated fairly.\u201d\n\nBut both Clover and del Valle have accused UC-Berkeley of mishandling the investigations by not responding promptly and consequentially to their complaints.\n\nIn the weeks and months after Clover told del Valle to stop contacting him, she said, she became unsettled by what she felt were similarities between what she was communicating on her cellphone and laptop and tweets she attributed to Clover. She would message a friend, she said, and within hours, a post would pop up on Clover\u2019s Twitter feed \u2014 or another she was convinced he had access to \u2014 that seemed to be indirectly referencing it. She wrote about planning to see a friend named Isis and he posted about a restaurant with the same name, she said. She was searching on the web for a good place for French lessons, and he tweeted \u201cMoving on to daily vous, daily ils elles\u201d. She had a cellphone conversation with her son about Kendrick Lamar\u2019s song \u201cHumble\u201d and over the next two days, the word \u201chumble\u201d appeared on the two Twitter feeds where she accused Clover of stalking her.\n\nWhere many would see coincidences, del Valle saw a pattern of harassment.\n\n...", "upvotes": 26}, {"body": "https://dailycal.org/2023/08/29/protestors-gather-in-california-hall-demand-reinstatement-of-uc-berkeley-professor/", "upvotes": 15}, {"body": "WTF", "upvotes": 10}, {"body": "I swear some shit just goes down every other week, and I\u2019m just out of the loop because I\u2019m too lazy to get to class.", "upvotes": 6}]}, {"title": "transfer struggling to make friends", "upvotes": 40, "created_utc": 1698296406.0, "id": "17gouww", "body": "hi, as the title says im (20f) having a really difficult time making friends at berkeley. i'm in two very social and awesome clubs, and even in a transfer community floor of my dorm, but i cant click with anyone. i'm bubbly and kind but have been told many times im scary or unapproachable when people first meet me but it's been far past that point, as in the people i want to be friends with know my personality now. \n\ni can't shake the feeling that i've missed the boat on making friends. everyone has their groups, the people they like, and they stick to it. i was very shy and reclusive my first month here and i feel like that completely screwed me over, because now even the transfers i've met have their friend groups now. i don't really get invited to anything even though i express that i want to go to things; i'm not annoying or pushy about it but i make it known i would like to be included and it just doesn't happen. \n\ni'm taking it really personally and it's been affecting my mental health a LOT. i've never been a person that has no friends or that no one wants to be around so its been complete emotional whiplash feeling that way at berkeley. i'm really trying to put myself out there but nothing has been working out.\n\nit would be comforting to know if others are experiencing this, because i've been feeling so alone", "comments": [{"body": "I feel the exact same.

It was built in the 1860s, and remodeled in an English Tudor style by architect Julia Morgan in 1911.\n\nThe man who commissioned the remodel, William Smyth, was a somewhat eccentric English engineer who made a fortune as an inventor and patent consultant (he often was an expert witness in trials). He lived and worked in San Francisco then retired to Berkeley, where he had his dream home. Several acres of gardens extending up the hill, and the house in the middle of it.\n\nSmyth wrote a lot, including essays and a book proposing that committees of well trained engineers should basically govern the world (he created the term \"Technocracy\"). So he would fit right in with today's EECS / tech culture at Berkeley. :-)\n\nBefore he died in the 1930s, he willed the property to the University. UC wasn't quite sure what to do with it, but as World War II came to an end and there was a sudden housing crisis for women students (with all the male students coming back from military service) the University hastily built several two story dormitories there for women, plus a dining commons. The house also stayed.\n\nIn the 1970s the dormitories were converted to family student apartments. In the 1990s (?) they were torn down, leaving most of the property vacant. UC still owns it.\n\nIt has periodically been discussed as a site for student or perhaps faculty housing. One of the complications is that the Hayward Fault runs through the lower part of the property (the meadow area below the house and above Hillside Avenue) so it's no longer allowed to build there. But there is still a lot of land up the canyon behind the house. \n\nHere's a good article that gives much of the history and has early pictures of the house. \n\nhttp://berkeleyheritage.com/eastbay\\_then-now/smyth.html", "upvotes": 15}]}, {"title": "How is there an endless number of hot boys at Berkeley", "upvotes": 93, "created_utc": 1698259944.0, "id": "17gc2xh", "body": "Genuinely, there are a myriad of hot boys on campus.

Assume (more accurately, inductively suppose) your recursive call(s) will produce the correct answer, and design the answer accordingly.\n\nFor example, you could even define a recursive function to add two to a given positive number, x. add\\_two(x). By the leap of faith, add\\_two(x-1) returns you (x-1) + 2, which is x+1. So to get from that, to the desired x+2, you just +1. So, add\\_two(x) = add\\_two(x-1) + 1. Base case is the smallest value in your input domain, in this case, return 3 for x == 1.\n\nFor tree recursion (i.e if you have more than one recursive case), the big thing to think about is how to break your problem into different cases. \n\nFor example, say you have this problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/), which asks you to count the number of ways to climb a staircase of n stairs with steps of size 1 or 2. The two cases to consider are whether you take a step of size 1 of step of size 2. If you take a step of size 1, then you have a staircase of n-1 steps left, which you can solve via leap of faith. Same with the other case. So in total, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n\nHope this helps, and happy to elaborate.

Applied Math and Data Science are both admitted directly to the major. Applied Math has 51%, and Data Science has a 13% acceptance rate. With my planned classes, I will only miss Data C8 and CS 61A for the Data Science major.

CDSS Data Science: \"We accept linear algebra without differential equations from California community colleges in all cases where the course is included in a Math 54 articulation agreement.\" In this case, the single Linear Algebra course at my CC will satisfy this requirement since it is in the two part articulation agreement of Math 54.

Tailgating is allowed at all campus parking lots BUT like I said those parking lots are super limited - the tailgate I attend, the guy who runs it donates in the low five figures to the athletic department so he gets parking. I either BART to the game or find street parking and walk over to the tailgate. As an urban campus and not a traditional big football school, we do a lot of pre gaming at bars or just walking up to the stadium.\n\n3. Gotta be 21. No drinking on the streets. There is alcohol for sale at the stadium but only on the west side of the stadium.\n\n4. PLENTY. Tons of campus adjacent eateries - Top Dog is a famous hot dog stand.

If you're on campus you will never be more than a ~15 minute walk from the stadium. Or walk through it after considering it is a day game. Also restaurants on Telegraph and Durant will be packed before/after the game (moreso considering its USC), so if you want to avoid crowds then consider eating somewhere on Shattuck or University, which also happens to be closer to BART. But sounds like you want something resembling a gameday experience in which case Telegraph/Durant is definitely the move.\n\nIf you had any connections to any frats at all, then their pregames would be the closest thing you can get to a \"gameday.\" But you probably don't, in which case just walk up the hill and admire as you go.", "upvotes": 3}, {"body": ">How does parking work?\n\nyou can pay out the ass for a private lot. drive around and you'll see \"parking for $XX\" in someone's garage. otherwise park west of telegraph ave and hike to the stadium. or take public transit \n\n>Where is tailgating allowed?\n\nberk being an urban campus..........there really isn't anywhere. unless you go to a private one \n\n>What are the rules around the sale of alcoholic beverages?\n\nusual american stuff? being over 21. \n\n>Are there venues to get food before the game?\n\nall the food spots along bancroft are the popular spots. top dog is an institution. la burrita. azn ghetto. \n\n>Any other suggestions to make the experience fluid would be appreciated.\n\n* bring layers. it'll be somewhat warm during the game. but as soon as the sun sets, the breeze will roll in and things will get chilly quickly \n\n* don't wear red! unless you want to get heckled the entire game \n\n* apparently this is strictly a berk thing - just go into the section on your ticket and then mosh in. don't bother looking for your exact row/seat", "upvotes": 3}, {"body": "Welcome to Berkeley!\n\nSome ad ons to the good comments from others.\n\nTaking BART is a good idea so you avoid parking problems. As others have noted, we're an urban campus so no huge surface parking lots or open fields for tailgating, and the campus parking that does exist is generally reserved for donors / season ticket holders. Also, the City of Berkeley sees football game traffic as a cash cow, and doubles parking fines and tickets on game day.\n\nThe BART stop you'll want to exit at is **Downtown Berkeley** (There are three Berkeley stations. It's the middle one). The campus is one block east, after you exit the station. Follow the crowds east / uphill. Keep going uphill and you'll reach the Stadium right at the base of the hills. Nice walk, especially on a Fall mid-day / afternoon.\n\nTake out food before the game. Cheese 'n Stuff, sandwich place underneath one of the city garages is good, and inexpensive, for take-out sandwiches. It's one block south of the campus, so you'll make a slight detour, but an easy walk to the Stadium after that.\n\n[https://www.yelp.com/biz/cheese-n-stuff-berkeley](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cheese-n-stuff-berkeley)\n\nWeather for the afternoon game should be mild and sunny, it looks like. After dark around here the temperature drops with colder air coming in off the ocean, so as others have noted, bring layers--hoodie, sweatshirt--to wear on the way back to BART and the ride back to your car. (But our night time temperatures are utterly mild compared to cold weather Canada.)\n\nCheck the BART schedule in advance. Trains on weekends don't run really often, so you should time your arrival at the station to avoid a long wait on the platform. (Compared to most big urban transit systems, BART is a relatively small operation).\n\nAs others have said, don't wear red--Stanford and USC color, and both schools are despised here. Our colors are blue and gold. Mustard yellow is also a USC color somewhat paralleling gold for Cal, so if you're wearing some sort of yellow, plus neutral, you will pass. Other neutrals are greens, browns, grays, and any sort of darker blue will fit you in just fine with a Berkeley crowd.\n\nBe prepared for the USC Band playing their same two, monotonous, spirit songs 50 times or more during the game. It just comes with the territory.\n\nAfter the game--and even during the fourth quarter or second half, if Cal is seriously losing--there will be a steady stream of people heading back to the BART station, and probably crowded trains leaving town. So if you want to avoid the crowding at BART, stopping somewhere to have dinner a good option. Both Southside (neighborhood immediately south of campus) and Downtown Berkeley (right around the BART station) have a lot of restaurants of several price ranges.\n\nTo add to the list of food places, **Jupiter**, on the same block as the BART station, is a downtown pub with a lot of outside seating.

I don't have the exact numbers to verify. But this is my opinion. Asian immigrants post 1968 were brought in solely to sow discord and fight civil rights. \n\n1968 the National Origins Act was repealed which had limited all immigration except Northern European immigration to I believe 1890 levels which shut immigration off largely to Asians. After this was passed we didn't just let everyone in. To gain entry you have to fill out tons of forms, have the money to travel from your nation. Most Asian Immigrants were likely educated and semi successful in their country of origin yet had a reason to leave. Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian immigrants were not necessarily chosen but humanitarian fix for the fuck ups of the Vietnam War. This is likely why you see a success divide between 'Successful' ethnicities of Asian descent vs not. Why is this important? The Model Minority serves as a symbol to tell others minorities not to fight for civil rights and do as the (Sarcastic) Model Minority does. That's why the Model Minority Myth is the work of White Supremacy.  Asians who fall for it are no better than other races who dislike Asians for that status perceived or real.

One thing that just irritates me is when a white liberal lectures me on colonization/slavery - btw your ancestors were colonizers and btw my ancestors were colonized (not by your ancestors but other Asian colonizers). \n\nConservative or liberal- many people are racist and often times liberals don't realize they are just as racist as conservatives. I do want to fight for social justice and sustainable development but there are too many \"liberals\" these days destroying this movement because they think their IQ is 1000 on racial capitalism\n\nI think white \"liberals\" are just racist to smart, successful people. They love struggling, depressed Asians- and I know because I was one. They disregard the fact that the East Asian Tigers developed because we worked hard- diligently, we saved/invested, we sacrificed for the next generation without much welfare spending. Some people think it was some sort of miracle/luck but a lot of Asian cultures value education, grades, competition, accomplishment, economic success, profit, income, property, wealth, money. Yes it's toxic at times but go to Korea/Japan/China/Singapore/HK, we have better public transportation, better institutions, prohibit drugs/guns \n\nwhite liberals today are salty white conservatives want to do business with smart, successful Asians.

I earned my high school diploma in 2017 as an international student with many AP courses under my belt, even received the state honored student award and scored a 1580 on the SAT. I went on to a four-year college on the East Coast to major in physics, but things went south due to a family crisis. My parents were in an accident, I lost my mother, and I thought I would soon be forced to go back home. But my father managed to support me financially all by himself, he told me during my first year summer vacation that I had to finish my degree. He made it clear that it was important for my family's sacrifices not to go in vain.\r And if you are wondering, International students generally weren't allowed to work and had to pay almost double the tuition compared to US citizens. It would be illegal for me to earn a dime in the U.S. (Tho I did do sth that I can't talk about, just to best utilize my free time and take off some pressure from my father). I never knew if I ever recover from this family crisis. But I am sure that I was lost, living like a zombie for two years, missing classes and exams. I ended up on academic probation by the end of my first year. In the end, I got dismissed after my second year.\r  \n\r  \n I did manage to bounce back a bit, but my stubbornness and ego, fueled by my high school achievements and all the praise I got, made me think I could handle the coursework all on my own. I 'proudly' refused any help from the school, and it resulted in me finishing my Differential Equations course with a C, along with a bunch of other Cs and Ds. Most of this was because I was dealing with depression and immense pressure, but I couldn't bring myself to talk to anyone about what I was going through. To make things worse, my father's expectations felt like an invisible weight hanging over my head. \r  \n\r  \nFast forward, I've now spent four years at CCC. The first two semesters weren't perfect either, with more Cs in physics and chemistry, I struggled to adapt to this new environment, not knowing anything and living all by myself. Then COVID came, and it finally hit me that I needed help and support for my coursework, just like anyone else, I am not the special kid they used to say. Believe it or not, I hadn't gone to any office hours at this point, not even once.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to salvage my GPA during COVID, but online courses didn't work out for me. I decided to go back home to East Asia because my father needed care during the pandemic lockdown. This meant dealing with a significant time difference, having to wake up at 2 am for Zoom, cooking meals during the day, and getting my HW done while trying to take a nap every minute I got. Looking back, it was like hell and pure pressure. I had insomnia and noticed significant palpitation at night when in the days I could finally get a regular sleep. It was during this time I thought about suicide, so many times, but whenever I saw my father lying in bed lecturing me to do a good job at school, I wanted to cry so badly and couldn't imagine what would do to him if I chose that easy path. Eventually, I took a semester off and returned to the US when things started to normalize.\r  \n\r\n\nFrom that semester forward, I managed to get all As in almost every class. If there's even a slight chance I can't get an A, I intentionally make it a D or an F so that I can retake it and improve my grade. \n\nNow, I'm in my last year at CCC, and all I can think about is my application to UC. Unfortunately, I couldn't do the Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) because they evaluated my GPA based on the order of courses I took. This means that even if I retake all the major courses, they won't count toward my cumulative GPA if my previous courses from the four-year college can be transferred to UC. Regardless of my performance at the community college, there is no chance I can get TAG from any UC. I have no guarantee of getting into any UC college, and I'm unsure if any school would even want me.  \n\nNevertheless, I'm taking life day by day now. I'm learning to focus on what's right in front of me. Even after all the setbacks, I still have a deep passion for studying physics, especially astrophysics. UCB has always been a dream school for me. If it wasn't for that lie, I'd be more than willing to spend another four years at a different CCC just to get into UCB and study astrophysics.\n\nCurrently, I hold a 3.1 GPA from CCC and a 1.18 from my previous university. As I contemplate my PiQ, I'm at a loss as to which part of my story to share. I don't even know if it's a personal drive pushing me or if I'm merely trying to meet my father's expectations. Sometimes I even felt proud of myself, being able to live through all that and still pretending to live like a normal person. Other times, I wonder if I'm still that same zombie from the earlier days, someone who no longer feels anything, and the As I'm earning is just me finally learning how to study effectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS. You might wonder why I didn't just drop the course. The thing is international students like me face minimum enrolled units restrictions. Dropping below that limit would jeopardize my visa status.\r You might also be wondering why my father still doesn't know after spending six years in a four-year college. Two years ago, I told him I was applying for a master's degree, but I got rejected by all of them. So I decided to change my major, extend the time needed for graduation, keep my visa, and try different programs at different schools. He was extremely disappointed that I was too afraid to go back home during the summer to face him.\r  \n\r  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4yuuqq66cvb1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab42eb2aaccc8d8f41b77c076ebc1610ab031f6b", "comments": [{"body": "Your best hope is your PIQ essays and picking a major with a high acceptance rate in the college of LS honestly.

Sources: Getty.\nOCTOBER 18, 2023\n\n\nSince william f. buckley published God and Man at Yale\u2014a best-selling book that criticized the \u201ccollectivist\u201d sympathies of professors at Buckley\u2019s alma mater\u2014in 1951, conservatives have argued that prestigious American universities are hotbeds of dangerous Marxist brainwashing. Whether espoused by Buckley in the \u201950s or by conservative firebrands today, the assertion that elite universities are sites of far-left indoctrination is and has always been a fantasy. The most popular major at Harvard, Yale, and many other supposedly leftist universities is economics\u2014not exactly the subject of choice for aspiring anti-capitalists. At the University of Pennsylvania, 50 percent of graduating students take jobs in finance or consulting. The figures at other Ivies aren\u2019t much lower. If these institutions are trying to produce Marxists, they are failing spectacularly.\n\nYet conservatives are right when they say that the Ivory Tower is a breeding ground for ideological extremism. The politics on offer at elite universities are not leftist in any substantive sense\u2014at least if by \u201cleftist\u201d you mean redistributive\u2014but they are radical. We might call it \u201ccorporate radicalism\u201d: a political sensibility that blends what the late writer Mark Fisher derisively referred to as \u201ccapitalist realism\u201d\u2014the conviction that free-market neoliberalism is broken but that there is no better alternative so we might as well embrace it\u2014with performative social justice that is as loud as it is toothless. Although academia has always been a haven for leftists, freethinkers, and creatives as well as crackpots, there used to be a kind of separation of church and state: Universities were refuges for radicals, but they were not themselves radical. (Consider the tensions between faculty and administrations during the campus protest movements of the 1960s.)\n\nIn recent years, however, college presidents, deans, and HR professionals have cribbed the language of edgy politics, openly framing their institutions and initiatives as aspirationally \u201canti-racist\u201d and \u201cdecolonial\u201d enterprises while welcoming \u201cscholar-activists\u201d: professors who see their research, political militancy, and pedagogy as mutually constitutive. You can see the fruit of this shift in a number of faculty members\u2019 responses to Hamas\u2019s attack on Israel earlier this month. Zareena Grewal, an American-studies professor at Yale, tweeted, \u201cSettlers are not civilians,\u201d implying that massacred Israelis couldn\u2019t be considered innocent. She also asserted that a young Israeli engineering student who had been kidnapped during a massacre at a rave shouldn\u2019t count as a noncombatant because she was \u201can IDF soldier/Israeli police officer.\u201d (Grewal has since locked her Twitter account.) Tenured and tenure-track professors at prestigious research institutions hastened to remind their Twitter followers that \u201cdecolonization is not a metaphor.\u201d The posts\u2014dated the same day as Hamas\u2019s attack\u2014quite plainly implied that decolonization necessarily entails terroristic violence.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: Students for Pogroms in Israel\n\nThe situation has proved to be a fiasco for elite colleges and universities, opening a new front in the ongoing culture war in higher education. The tension bursting into view right now\u2014between a majority of scholars, for whom \u201cdecolonization\u201d means putting fewer white Europeans on their syllabi, and a small minority who believe it entails anything-goes violent revolution\u2014is the unwelcome and unsurprising result of universities wanting to cosplay rebellion while still churning out Wall Street\u2013executive alumni who will one day pad endowments that are larger than Israel\u2019s annual defense budget.\n\nIn short, elite universities are in a bind, floundering in their attempts to navigate the Israel-Palestine conflict, because they have passed the better part of a decade making themselves political. If college presidents had not spent the past few years issuing watery, say-nothing statements about every crisis in current affairs, they would not now be expected to register their opinion on the conflagration in the Middle East. If they had not slapped the words decolonization and anti-racism on so many campus initiatives, they would not now be implicated as ideological co-conspirators every time one of their faculty members labels a terrorist attack \u201cdecolonization,\u201d or whenever an \u201canti-racist\u201d research institute is hit with a major scandal. And above all, if they had not indulged the preposterous notion that unpopular or even offensive ideas are a form of \u201cviolence\u201d that their students must be protected from, they would not now look so hypocritical when members of their campus community voice enthusiasm for actual violence. If universities had been more circumspect in the past, they could credibly say that they believe in academic freedom\u2014regardless of whatever administrators themselves may think of the ideas that their students and faculty champion\u2014and leave it at that.\n\nInstead, deluded into believing that the Ivory Tower could be both a site of social justice and a factory for finance bros, elite universities bit the poison apple of politics. Enter corporate radicalism.\n\nIoften describe myself as a \u201csoft Marxist.\u201d I say that because my politics slouch toward reformist social democracy, not revolutionary overhaul. But I am nonetheless a Marxist, because I hold the traditionally Marxist view that the ideas that dominate at a given place and time tend not to be the ideas of the working classes\u2014the humble majority\u2014but rather of the elites. \u201cThe class which is the ruling material force of society,\u201d Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels declared, \u201cis at the same time its ruling intellectual force.\u201d Though the conservative accusation that prestigious universities are \u201cculturally Marxist\u201d is little more than a conspiracy theory, ironically, Marxism can help us understand the ideologies that prevail at these institutions.\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective, there are only two possible explanations for the radical politics emerging out of Harvard and company: Either, against all odds, a genuinely revolutionary political project\u2014decolonization, anti-racism, etc.\u2014has been secreted out of the inner sanctum of the American elite to destabilize it from within, or these \u201cradical\u201d political ideologies are in fact little more than wallpaper serving the interests of the ruling class by morally laundering an education system that doles out advantages to the mediocre rich and then calls this process a \u201cmeritocracy.\u201d Although miracles are certainly possible, history\u2014and common sense\u2014militates in favor of the latter.\n\n1 of 2", "upvotes": 16}, {"body": "IMHO one of the main reasons why hard-core conservatives keep shitting on us (and education as a whole) can be boiled down to one simple reason...\n\nMany of us are bright and hopeful young people who want to change the future.

I am looking for someone who is able to adopt my cat and give her a good life. Theo came into my life a year ago. She has urinary retention issues, meaning she sometimes has episodes where she is not able to pee. She goes in and out of her litter box and when she sees she can't pee, she starts to squat in other \"safe spaces\" around our apartment. Small drops will come out, sometimes with blood, sometimes they are clear. These episodes vary in frequency, sometimes it only happens once a month, sometimes it is two times a week. My landlord has giving me an ultimatum due to her leaving pee on the bathroom baseboards (this is where I put her every time she has an episode so she doesn't do it on the rest of the apartment) and I've washed them before but some don't come out and they are accumulating. I am not able to afford a move so I'm desperately looking for someone who can take care of her. She is a great cat, very docile, wouldn't hurt a fly, and she is a total lap cat. She loves to be pet, she will sleep on the bed throughout the night, so she is not a noisy cat that won't let you sleep. She also has some mobility issues but they are not a big deal, she can still walk, run, and climb but she cannot jump too high, so the kitchen counters are save from her.

This is actually working because rational liberals/true progressives/moderate/conservative white people + people of other colors who had experiences with racist white liberals **UNITE** to dismantle the disillusioned left.  The 'so called liberals' can't think outside the left box and are resorting to making personal attacks at me (which further proves they are super annoying and stupid) because I presented an argument that goes against their agenda using a speech from one of their heroes -Malcom X. who I respect a lot\n\nAlso, I referred to white liberals as \"the most racist\" as a click-bait or trigger- trying to use the methodology the leftists often use to make an overgeneralization of every societal issues such as ex. 'women are better leaders than men' or 'Asian guys cannot drive well' (which can be true in most cases but not in an absolute term)\n\nThe thing is when I try to rationally debate (yes my major is stuff related to this) liberals, I fail to have a conversation because I'm racist/sexist/ignorant/privileged/international student with F1 visa ... a lot of liberals use logic based on feelings, emotions, experiences and ofc those are important and could be validated but shutting down any argument using 'I/someone feel offended' is going to get you nowhere.\n\nI wish we could restore liberalism, social justice, sustainable development to their true nature and cut out all the bs logic the left is pushing because that can destroy not just the US but the entire human civilization. I hope we stop absorbing whatever these old Professors are saying but question their belief/books/presentations/lectures because some are too old to keep up with what's going on in today's world-like why'd u trust an old man who can't even figure out how to use zoom or beam projector.\n\nI'm sorry but there are amazing Professors but they may not be the best source to learn about stuff like the effect of technology on our economy (talking about l&s prof )\n\n**response**:\n\nresponding to several comments about the pronoun part- I usually use 'they' to avoid misgendering and if I ask and confirm the person's gender, I try my best to use the correct pronoun\n\nresponding to generalizing white liberals- I think a lot of people are racist and I apologize for saying white liberals are the \"most racist\" because that's probably not true statistically but true in my experience (lived in different countries, cities and continents). I find too much hypocrisy from interacting with white \"liberals\"- I put this in quotation because they believe they are liberals but aren't. Both conservatives and liberals can be racist but it gets annoying when liberals think they know everything about race theory/history and accuse people of being racist when they are also being racist. Conservatives and moderates tend not to contextualize every American politics/economic/cultural/social/emotional issues under the race framework.\n\nThis is a quote Malcom X and he has a point that more people should read:\n\n>\"In this deceitful American game of power politics, the Negroes (i.e., the race problem, the integration and civil rights issues) are nothing but tools, used by one group of whites called Liberals against another group of whites called Conservatives, either to get into power or to remain in power. Among whites here in America, the political teams are no longer divided into Democrats and Republicans. The whites who are now struggling for control of the American political throne are divided into \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" camps. The white liberals from both parties cross party lines to work together toward the same goal, and white conservatives from both parties do likewise.  \n>  \n>The white liberal differs from the white conservative only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative. The liberal is more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor; and by winning the friendship, allegiance, and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or tool in this political \"football game\" that is constantly raging between the white liberals and white conservatives.  \n>  \n>Politically the American Negro is nothing but a football and the white liberals control this mentally dead ball through tricks of tokenism: false promises of integration and civil rights. In this profitable game of deceiving and exploiting the political politician of the American Negro, those white liberals have the willing cooperation of the Negro civil rights leaders. These \"leaders\" sell out our people for just a few crumbs of token recognition and token gains.

Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist known for his contributions to the development of nuclear weapons and later nuclear fusion research, found himself in a peculiar situation.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, Oppenheimer was discussing the intricacies of nuclear fusion in a top-secret laboratory on the UC Berkeley campus. His colleagues and subordinates, who were often privy to the enigmatic world of atomic science, were conducting their experiments and calculations with utmost focus. The laboratory was abuzz with the hum of machinery and the gentle hum of scientists pondering over their equations, all within the ivy-covered walls of the prestigious university.\n\nIn the midst of a particularly intense discussion about the behavior of plasma in fusion reactors, a newly recruited young physicist named \"Squirrel\" entered the lab. He glanced around at the serious faces and complex apparatus and realized he had no idea what was happening.\n\nFeeling a bit lost and overwhelmed in the esteemed setting of UC Berkeley, Squirrel approached Oppenheimer, cleared his throat nervously, and finally asked, \"Excuse me, Dr. Oppenheimer, is this area safe?\"\n\nOppenheimer, known for his profound intellect and often cryptic humor, paused and gave the matter serious thought. He looked around at the radiation suits, the swirling magnetic fields, and the intimidating machinery, all within the storied walls of UC Berkeley. He then replied with a sly grin, \"Well, my young friend, as safe as can be expected when you're playing with the power of the stars on the hallowed grounds of this esteemed institution.\"\n\nThe entire laboratory, situated within the vibrant campus of UC Berkeley, burst into laughter, with Oppenheimer's response breaking the tension and reminding everyone that sometimes, even in the pursuit of the most complex and groundbreaking science, a good sense of humor can be a powerful tool.\n\nFrom that day forward, \"Is this area safe?\" became a running joke in the Oppenheimer lab, intertwined with the rich history of UC Berkeley. It was a reminder that when you're pushing the boundaries of human knowledge on a campus renowned for academic excellence, a little humor can go a long way to lighten the heavy burden of scientific discovery. It was a lesson that Oppenheimer and his team carried with them into the future, whether they were exploring the heart of the atom or seeking to unlock the secrets of nuclear fusion, all under the watchful gaze of UC Berkeley's iconic campanile.", "comments": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|yoJC2nt2jACN8swJSU)", "upvotes": 7}, {"body": "Truly one of the Reddit posts of all time", "upvotes": 6}, {"body": "TF did I just read?", "upvotes": 3}, {"body": "In which building was their lab located?

For example, school (both K-12 and colleges/universities) are legally (and morally) obligated to prevent harassment of and discrimination against Palestinian students.  \n\n\nThis is similar to how under Title IX, schools must prevent sexual harassment/assault and harassment of LGBTQ+ students, since both are examples of sex-based discrimination; schools similarly must prevent harassment of Palestinian students, faculty, staff, etc - and not just in housing!  \n\n\nFor example, if an [elected official brandishes a gun](https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-councilwoman-inna-vernikov-arrested-after-openly-carrying-firearm-at-brooklyn-college-rally) on campus in order to intimidate Palestinian students, the school has a legal and moral obligation to prevent further harassment (e.g. by banning the perpetrator from campus, regardless of whether or not it was a crime to brandish the gun on campus); the same applies to brandishing a knife in the dorms - or elsewhere - in an attempt to intimidate Palestinian students.  \n\n\nIn the case of college housing, housing civil rights laws provide additional legal prohibitions against discrimination against Palestinian students. (And of course, these laws also cover non-college housing.)  \n\n\nFinally, it's important to remember that just becausec the law prohibits something bad, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be meaningfully enforced against perpetrators; for example, the University of California and   \nUC Berkeley have a notorious history of illegally allowing and even directly perpetuating anti-Palestinian bigotry/oppression.

The campus had become the unlikely stage for the first-ever \"Squirrellympics,\" a sporting extravaganza of epic proportions that would be told for generations.\n\nThe red squirrels, famed for their nimbleness, gathered on one end of the 1,232-acre campus. These pint-sized acrobats, with their tails stretching up to 20cm (8 inches), were about to embark on a squirrel-sized revolution. They had a plan - and it was a plan of colossal proportions. They calculated that they could fit an astonishing 113,427,748 red squirrels into the campus. How? They decided to form the world's tallest squirrel pyramid. You could barely see the campus anymore; it had transformed into a squirrel skyscraper. The spectacle had everyone in stitches, and the world had never seen anything quite like it.\n\nOn the opposite end of the campus, the grey squirrels, who were larger and had tails of up to 25cm (10 inches), had their own trick up their sleeves. They organized a \"Squirrel Rocket Race\" to take over the world. The campus quaked as they built squirrel-powered rockets, ready to launch them to the moon and back. With space for 73,922,828 grey squirrels, their rocket squad looked like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. The countdown began, and they shot toward the stars, leaving a trail of nuts and acorns in their cosmic wake.\n\nAmidst the chaos, a wise old squirrel named Sir Nuts-a-Lot had an epiphany. He realized that the real prize wasn't about squirrel skyscrapers or squirrel rockets. It was about the laughter, camaraderie, and nutty fun shared among friends. With tails held high and laughter in their hearts, he invited all the squirrels to join in the world's longest squirrel conga line.\n\nRed squirrels and grey squirrels danced together, their tails forming an unbroken link that stretched across the campus. As they danced and laughed, they understood that the size of your tail or your ambition didn't matter; it was the joy of living in the moment that truly counted. The echoes of their laughter rang through the 1,232-acre campus, leaving a memory etched in the hearts of all squirrels, a reminder that joy is always worth celebrating, tails held high.

You might want to get comfortable for this read cus it's gona be long one, but hopefully it will be helpful to you and anyone that is in the same transition period you are in.\n\nI'll start all the way in the beginning.  When I graduated in the winter of 2018, it took me about month to mentally recovered from finally graduating from cal.  But one day, I finally found myself awake, staring at the ceiling, asking myself the dreadful \"now what?\"  At first I really didn't know where to start, other than the most logical first step to me, which was start working on my resume.  I was a transfer student that came in majoring in econ, but switched to applied math after my first year.  So I spent my summers catching up on courses, meaning I was not able to work in an internship(not that I looked for them anyway, cal was about all I could handled).  So I really started from square one.  Back in 2018, US had historically low unemployment rate, and it still took me about 7 months to find me first full time job.  So the good news for you is, what you are experience is not out of the norm.  Like many things, the beginning is always the toughest, so hang in there.\n\nWhile working on my resume at my parents' house, I realized I have no money lol.  So when I made that realization.  I reached out to my old boss at my junior college and asked for my old tutoring job back.  Luckily, I left on very good terms when I transferred, and a cal math grad was pretty alluring at a junior college, so I got my old job back working about 20 hours a week.  Which brings me to my first point, which is get a job, any job(if you haven't already), especially ones like tutoring which allows you to have flexibility to learn new skills and work on applying are especially great.  While all the grads here know what an achievement it is to graduate from cal, the first thing I had to learn was that at that point in time, it no longer matters.\n\nJust like you don't want be the guy bragging about his/her time in high school in college, college is your past now.  You are a \"real\" adult now.  That image of the person you want to be \"when you grow up\", now is the time to put in the work to BE that person.  I say that because it is easy to think working in a grocery store, or McD is beneath you as a cal grad.  But, it really is not.  Having a part time job like that gives the structure a recent grad sorely needs, while still allowing enough time to work on getting a \"real\" job.  Not to mention, you get paid, which will do wonders with that self esteem issues.  It also sends  a message to your strict parents you are trying and aren't being a deadbeat.  As hard as it is to hear, trying to get a job you think you deserved is not sufficient excuse to not pay for the food you're eating, because that IS beneath you as a cal grad.  While I was working as a tutor, I had a lot of down time.  So I learned excel, I took cs61a online by watching denero's videos on youtube, and using the online resources from previous year, I learned anything that I thought made me more employable.  It is natural to have skill gaps when you just graduate, the time between your first job and graduation can be very valuable in acquiring skills that you get you employed and paid.  Even then I realized, there aren't many situations in life where I can just study because I want to, and have the TIME to do so.\n\nWhile I was working as a tutor and learning more skills, I was also sending out resume like crazy.  I find that it's important to have a hard number to stick to.  For me it was at least 20 resume a day.  I quickly find that it's more important that I send the resume out instead of making my resume perfect or a company I want.  It really is a numbers game, if you're not sending enough out, you're just not going to get interviews.  I liked sites liked zip recruiters a lot because it had a 1 click apply option when you upload your resume.  So when I wasn't working, or learning, I was scrolling job sites like reddit, applying for jobs.\n\nSo I basically followed the routine of going to work, study, and applying for jobs, going to interviews when I got them, this continued for like 7 months before I landed a job as a data analyst at this traffic data gathering company, the pay was 33k a year.  I live in Diamond bar at this point, and the job was in culver city.  My salary was clearly not enough to move out on, and it takes almost 2 hours of driving to get there in the morning, and almost as long to get back.  The job clearly sucks, so it'd be stupid to take it right?  WRONG, you're just not gona get your dream job right off the bat, and if you're honest with yourself, you're probably not that qualify for it even if you did get it.  Yeah the job sucks, and I knew i can do better, but it was still an improvement over my part time job by the virtue that it paid more and it's something I can put on my resume.  However, almost 4 hours of commute was extremely wasteful if I want to continue to expand my skillset and look for a better job.  So, I did the math.  I begin waking up at 4:30am every morning, drive for about 40 minutes to culver city.  Then I would find a space and park, sleep until 7, got to a nearby starbucks and learn data analysis and wrangling techniques in python, then go to work at 9.  All in the while, I was still scrolling job site like reddit, still applying, while updating my skillset and resume.  Another 1.5 months went by, a friend I know from junior college and also went to cal with told me about her firm is hiring.  I applied, and got the job, which was in century city(even farther than culver city).

It is absolutely horrific and disgusting to see some people trying to justify/ contextualize this atrocity. It is absolutely insane that me as an Asian woman in Berkeley is against anti-semitism and is troubled by the fact that some of these \"so called liberals\"/communists/marxists/socialists/ feminists/ environmentalists/ college professors/ media outlets/\"so called progressives\" students are ignoring and refusing to condemn egregious human right abuses/ terrorism/ mass genocide. At this point, people standing up for women rights/ lgbtq rights/ black peoples rights/ animal rights/ environmental protection rights and AT THE SAME TIME thinking it's kinda okay to mass murder babies and rape women is INSANE. NO sane human being would find kidnapping babies and posting videos on social media of massacring innocent babies acceptable. This is not just a crime against Jews. IT IS CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY. \n\nI cannot believe that I, as an ASIAN WOMAN, am being \"cancelled\" in Berkeley ...because I speak about my feelings and opinions- I thought we were supposed to tolerate whatever emotion a human being has but NO only certain emotions are valid. It is frightening that I cannot participate in class or write an essay that actually reflect my thoughts because I get angry faces from my classmates and I have to write exactly what the Professor has said to get good grades- ironically, I am supposed to be creative and input my analysis but having diverse perspective is no longer acceptable. \n\nI talked to my friends at Cal yesterday and today about Hamas. It is so brutally frustrating that my friends who haven't read a single article/wikipedia page/asked chatGPT and don't know what's happening - talk as if they know everything from seeing Instagram posts. Hatred towards Jews is so embedded in peoples\u2019 minds that it's hard to have a healthy discourse around the Israel-Palestinian conflict. I could be unfriended if I make a comment about Hamas being a terrorist organization or if I just ask a question out of curiosity. It's dangerous to see how young people (this also applies to me) today are so so ignorant and irrational but we are soooooo overly confident and obnoxious and  arrogant about our college degree and being \"educated\" - we think we were taught to think but we were taught to absorb whatever a teacher or celebrity or politician or youtuber or influencer felt and said.\n\nOur society ,at least here in college, think we are morally upright but at the same time we allow or try to sort give grounds for terrorism and resign to immorality. We lost our capacity to think and we sleep on mass atrocities. We are utterly blinded when the sun rise. There is Truth and there is Morality in this world. We need to learn to think and question- to think independently and critically. \n\nOur society has become more divisive because we no longer see what the root cause of the issues are. Institutions, governments, schools, organization have put blinds in our windows because they don\u2019t really care about us even if they think they do care about us. They stir and fuel more hatred and anger. We need to start asking what the real problem is. We have become a society where asking a harmless question such as 'do you think affirmative action is racist? or 'do you think the US has better women's rights than Afghanistan?'' itself is being racist and sexist. Asking a question (because I am dumb and curious) means I'm being offensive and hateful?? Where do you draw the line with hate speech and free speech? My friends tell me asking such questions can hurt people's feelings because of my intention- I had 0 intention of being racist/ sexist and HOW DARE YOU ASSUME MY INTENTION and MY IDENTITY? The 'WOKE' culture has done their job making me WOKE and making me finally see how hypocritical, nasty, disgusting these politicians, celebrities, journalists, the elites are. We need to start waking up to realize what Hamas did is\u00a0a crime-a crime against humanity and our society not recognizing it as a crime is a crime.

We can go to either lecture, sections for either instructor, etc, etc.\n\nProf. Talaska had been feeling ill for a while now, in large part from trying to catch up with all the grading for her Math 10B class last semester which had fallen behind because of the strike, so she hadn't really put in the work into this semester's Math 54 class that Prof. Wehrheim was expecting from a jointly-run class which put immense stress on them from having to run everything by themselves for the past few weeks.\n\nProf. Talaska decided last week that it was probably best that she stop instructing the class for the aforementioned health reasons, which left Prof. Wehrheim with the job of teaching all 1000+ students which they obviously couldn't do, despite the math department's push for it.\n\nThe department also pushed for Prof. Wehrheim to instead teach alongside the (undecided) replacement instructor for Prof. Talaska, but given the current structure of the course (lectures and section are all group work essentially, worksheets are used daily and upload to a Drive folder, etc.), so Prof. Wehrheim decided that it wouldn't work out and that a new instructor would be completely out of the loop given how the class is currently being ran, so after thinking about it with family and friends over the weekend, they decided to take a leave too.\n\nAs such, we don't really know the future of this class, Prof. Wehrheim said it's unlikely to be cancelled, but that if we get new professors, neither we nor they have any idea how the class will be run, but Prof. Wehrheim insists we should fight for things that the class has already promised us and were outlined during Week 1 in the syllabus, as is stated by University policy (take home quizzes, projects instead of midterm/final exams etc), and so that's where things stand at the moment for the class.

(Follow Up)](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/x7jukv/rejected_again_follow_up/). \n\nAs a team of 6 passionate individuals, this past semester we worked on creating a club at Berkeley that addressed the issue of exclusive tech clubs and create a more inclusive and welcoming community. We are proud to introduce [Open Project](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXTwEzhup6Ws2oL_kfyPpgiXnkoq9TI2jQBLVBfmkYIodKGQ/viewform) \\- a club that not only addresses these issues, but also offers all the same exciting opportunities as traditional tech clubs, but without a rigorous selection process!\n\nOur club offers a dynamic array of projects, ranging from web/mobile development to data science. The projects undertaken each semester are student-led, with members empowered to propose ideas, evaluate options, and select the projects they want to work on, rather than being constrained by predefined projects. This allows for a highly personalized and fulfilling experience for all members.\n\nProject teams will be with a small group of students (5-7) to encourage a tight knit community where team members can really get to know each other. Socials beyond general team meetings will vary by team such as after-meeting dinners or late night boba runs. In addition, there will be multiple club wide socials throughout the semester so you have the chance to meet everyone in the club!\n\nThe [application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXTwEzhup6Ws2oL_kfyPpgiXnkoq9TI2jQBLVBfmkYIodKGQ/viewform) is super simple and quick.

If you disagree and think the ph\u1edf was good, please tell me to help me prove I'm going insane and elaborate why.  I'd like to point out possible suggestions to improve the 'pho bar' experience if they would like to reintroduce it.  I'll be sending these suggestions in the CalDining feedback form but thought it would be nice to share these with others.\n\nBefore I give my suggestions.  Here are some things I did enjoy from the ph\u1edf bar today.  \n\n1. There were plenty of ingredients for us to add including bean sprouts, lime, cilantro, leaves (can't remember what kind), brisket (which actually might have been the tri-tip), and much more!  There was even a condiment section with chili, hoisin, and fish sauce!  I genuinely felt like I was at a ph\u1edf restaurant for a brief moment.\n2. The label for fish sauce was \"nuoc nam\" <-spelled exactly that way.  I was very impressed that CalDining used the Vietnamese name for fish sauce.  I'm more familiar with it being spelled as 'n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm', spelled with an 'm', but that label helped me remember that the alternative spelling for n\u01b0\u1edbc m\u1eafm exists, so kudos to them! \n3. The beef brisket was well-seasoned and overall not bad.\n4. Side note, but the c\u00e0 ph\u00ea s\u1eefa \u0111\u00e1 (Vietnamese Iced Coffee) was really refreshing.  I honestly think that it should be served regularly.  It's almost on par with the Passion Orange Guava juice and is the best coffee I've ever had from CalDining.\n\nPh\u1edf is a complicated dish, I'll give them that.  However, it was far from decent in my honest opinion.   \nPh\u1edf K & K, a restaurant that many Vietnamese Cal students have strong opinions about, is much superior to this.  Here are my suggestions.\n\n1. **Cook the noodles thoroughly before serving them:**  The noodles had the consistency and texture of bean sprouts.  In other words, they were raw and quite crunchy.  Perhaps the chefs decided to undercook the noodles before serving into let the noodles simmer in the broth when added to gain the noodles' optimal texture.  However, the given broth wasn't even warm enough to do that.\n2. **Serve the broth at a higher temperature:**  As stated earlier, this can help cook the noodles as its being served.  I doubt that there would be a point where the noodles become overcooked and soggy,  Also, many people don't scoop as much on their plates so it cools down quickly, especially on a paper plate. It doesn't have to be boiling hot, but at least make it as hot as the other soups that are regularly served.\n3. **Give us chopsticks:**  They're cheap and don't have to be reusable.  Last semester, Cafe 3 served an Asian meal that they provided chopsticks with students.  Although it was pretty funny seeing everyone in the dining hall eat ph\u1edf with a fork.\n4. **Have servers serve the ph\u1edf to the students:**  Many students were spilling the broth while struggling to scoop it into their small paper bowls.  There was soup all over the counter, which is the result of students waiting thirty minutes in line and quickly grabbing ingredients.  This is a huge waste of soup which could have easily been prevented.  \n5. **Add more seasoning to the broth:**  It tasted like it was diluted with water.  I honestly have no clue on how someone could make a broth taste like that.  \n6. This is a little extra but maybe **provide a brief history and overview of ph\u1edf and how it is commonly eaten:**  This would be a brilliant idea to establish with every dish at CalDining.  Something like this would help familiarize students with the dish and how it is commonly eaten to help them understand exactly what's being served.\n\nWhy does something like this matter and why am I suddenly being so picky?  I understand that CalDining's approach to introduce a diverse menu is extremely important in order to celebrate diversity and inclusion. I also understand that I shouldn't expect a five-star meal from CalDining. As a Vietnamese person, I get very excited when UC Berkeley's dining halls serve dishes of my ethnicity.  However, I left the dining hall today feeling offended, insulted, and even a little sick.  I didn't expect perfection, but even after so many negative experiences at dining halls, I didn't think that the ph\u1edf at CalDining would be this abysmal.  When a dining hall botches up cultural food, it ironically gives a bad outlook to not only CalDining, but also the culture it tries to introduce to its students.  Imagine someone trying ph\u1edf for the first time at CalDining and being given raw noodles and cold broth.  Would a dish like this really encourage that person to want to try ph\u1edf again?\n\nIf the point of serving ph\u1edf was to demonstrate inclusivity and diversity as the #1 public university during the \"lunar new year season\", then the execution of it shouldn't have been this disappointing for so many people.  If CalDining chooses to reintroduce the ph\u1edf bar, then hopefully following these suggestions would help make ph\u1edf become one of CalDining's most favored items!", "upvote_count": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Ok listen up chef maestro \u2014 you need to remember you\u2019re eating at a dining hall not a typical restaurant.

No it hasn't avoid at all cost.\n\nEdit\\* coincidentally my wifi is dead right now and it's only my unit not the building. interesting\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince apartment hunting season is coming up. I thought I'll expose these \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* once and for all.\n\nHere's a google review I wrote 1 month ago:\n\n1. There are mandatory trash collection which you have to pay for and are billed for monthly. They only collect in the late afternoon for around 2 hours, and if they catch you having the trash outside the \"collection period\" you will be fined. They don't even collect the trash half the time.. 2. The apartments themselves are horribly designed. Storage areas are either inconvenient or are way too small. They even have \"fake\" storage areas that look it'll be useful but inside 90% of the room is taken up by something. 3. Lying and bad management. Asked if there would be fans in the apartment, they said yes, but guess what. There's no fans. Was promised a replacement for something within 2 weeks, but after 3 months, still nothing. I've had numerous packages stolen when delivery left it in the mailroom which had security cameras. I contacted the management about this issue and requested security footage to see who is stealing my packages, but they refused and ignored my request. (note: the security camera is ON and is pointing directly at where my package was left, I know this because I had to go to class and saw my package on the way out, but when I came back it was missing. What's the point of having these cameras if they aren't going to use it? Now whenever I order something expensive, I have to go downstairs to pick it up right away or else it gets stolen. I think the fastest time a package was stolen from me was 30 minutes after I received the delivered confirmation.  4. Security issues. The apartment garage door was broken for several weeks, but instead of repairing it, they simply left it open. Over these weeks, bicycles were stolen with the locks cut. Numerous residents contacted management about this but were all ignored.  5. random inconveniences: the apartment is \"gated\" and you need to use a key fob to get in. That means, no food delivery because they don't have key fobs so you would need to go downstairs to pick it up. That isn't too big of an issue, but what is, is that any delivery service that isn't amazon, fedex, ups or usps, cannot get into the apartment. So unless you want your package to sit outside in downtown berkeley (not recommended) you would need to be there whenever the delivery person arrives or else too bad. Wifi is included but that also means your not allowed to get different plans or different service providers. Internet here is more unreliable than campus wifi, it constantly freezes/disconnects.\n\nOutside of building always smells like weed and there's a big construction next to us.\n\nElevator feels like it's about to break anytime now, I straight up don't trust it anymore and just take the stairs.\n\nRoof top just started renovation couple weeks ago even though management said they would start like 5 months ago and be finished by now.\n\n////\n\nNow to add even more things that has happened:\n\nWe had no hot water for nearly **a month** and this was their response:\n\ntldr here: $125 compensation for \\~1 month of no hot water (our water heating bill was \\~$80 this month)\n\n[I'm taking them to small courts claim](https://preview.redd.it/wrti4gnrnjfa1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=28c54dfd15cda6eb1486e521e483da4669efafff)\n\nWe had an incorrect size fridge for 5 months and I've asked them to replace it multiple times. They said they ordered it and will replace it soon and then they said they can't replace it anymore xDDDD. Here are the screenshots:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dt41affeojfa1.png?width=2230&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b22cced54765bea18b421071167e54ffebfd950\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbiw6lgdojfa1.png?width=2232&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f3bb0dcb14a07d23aa1d295854fcf2bbbd9249\n\nsorry for the long rant but I really hope no one else has to experience this.\n\ntldr; avoid them at all cost like I cba anymore.\n\nalso I know management is going to read this and know who I am but idc.

This is just based off stuff I've seen on AC Transit from people who maybe aren't familiar with riding the bus, please comment if you have other things. This is meant as a judgment-free thread. \n\n-When the bus pulls up to the stop, let other people get off the bus before getting on. If someone with a mobility aid is getting off, sometimes the driver will deploy a ramp for them from the front door. Move back and let them pass.\n\n-If the bus is crowded (or likely to get crowded), move as far to the back of the bus as possible to make room. If there's an open seat, take it, even if it's next to a stranger. You're still helping to make room on the bus by doing so. I can't tell you how many times I've seen people standing in the aisle who are blocking others from getting to seats.\n\n-If you're standing in a crowded bus, take off your backpack to make room. (That goes for crowded BART cars too.) \n\n-If you're trying to get off a crowded bus and people aren't moving, don't scream or shove, but say something along the lines of \"excuse me, please let me off.\" Sometimes people are in your way because they're letting other people off, so just give it a second. \n\n-Sometimes the bus is so crowded (cough 51B cough) that you have to stand next to the back doors. If that happens, allow people to exit by temporarily stepping off the bus and then stepping back on after people have exited. Keep an arm on the door if you're worried about them closing--it doesn't take much force to stop them. \n\n-Obviously if you're in the priority seating for the elderly and people with mobility aids (and you're not elderly or using a mobility aid), be ready to give up your seat to someone who needs it. Even if you're not in priority seating, it's considered polite to offer your seat to someone who needs it (a senior citizen, a parent with a baby, etc.) \n\n-If you're sitting in an aisle seat and the person in the seat next to you is getting off, get up and let them pass. Please don't just swing your legs into the aisle or lean away from them. If they have stuff they are carrying (backpack, big purse, baby in lap, whatever ) they will need room to maneuver into the aisle. You probably don't want them losing their balance and dropping that stuff on you.\n\n-Maybe this is just me, but it's kind of gross when people eat on the bus, and it's technically not allowed but I've never seen a driver enforce it. Drinks (not the adult kind) are usually fine. I have seen drivers tell people to dump soda cups, but I've never had one give me a hard time for a coffee cup.\n\n-Not etiquette but a pro tip that a bus driver told me once: if you're ever at poorly-lit bus stop at night and worried the bus will blow past you, turn the flashlight of your phone on. It makes you easier for the driver to see.\n\nETA thanks for the award!", "upvote_count": 399, "comments": [{"body": "Obligatory \u201cdon\u2019t forget to thank the bus driver!\u201d", "id": "j6thiz3", "link_id": "t3_10r3j5d", "upvote_count": 201}, {"body": "That\u2019s the neat part, you don\u2019t. \nIt\u2019s the golden rule my friend", "id": "j6tswdy", "link_id": "t3_10r3j5d", "upvote_count": 113}, {"body": "Basic courtesy - you\u2019re def from out of town", "id": "j6tt5fi", "link_id": "t3_10r3j5d", "upvote_count": 56}, {"body": "Awesome tips.

One of them a block from the campus, the other three blocks. \n\nI have no idea how hard it is to get a space, but the total amount of residents they can accommodate is only a tiny fraction of the overall graduate student population. Most grad students, by necessity, live in private, non-UC, rentals.\n\nI'm somewhat surprised to see the two other housing complexes listed. Those are privately owned, I believe. Not sure what sort of deal the owners might have talked the campus into, to specially promote them on a campus website, unless perhaps the campus has leased the whole buildings and guaranteed to fill them with students. I don't know. If you apply to either, definitely ask *\"is this UC run?\", \"who sets the rents?\", \"who manages this building?\"* and other relevant questions.\n\nThe \"Panoramic Berkeley\" is very close to campus (five short blocks), on Telegraph Avenue, so an easy walk *(it's also one of the ugliest new buildings in Berkeley, but that's another topic...)*\n\nThe \"Intersection\" housing listed is FAR away from campus. Miles. Two cities away, actually. There are hundreds of private apartment buildings in Berkeley and nearby that are closer located and, often, in better neighborhoods. The listing says it is \"15 minutes\" walk from the MacArthur BART station which may be true if you are fit and walking really fast. It looks like at least 2/3rds of a mile away from the BART station to me, on a map. And I would personally not want to be walking through that neighborhood alone, at night. If you were riding a bike, it would be an steady uphill climb most of the way and a *long* ride to campus, and back, that would take you along some streets pretty busy with traffic.", "id": "j6vkvg2", "link_id": "t3_10rerw1", "upvote_count": 4}, {"body": "[deleted]", "id": "j6vme76", "link_id": "t3_10rerw1", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "Not currently a student and haven't looked for housing recently, and so don't know what rooms are going for; hopefully some current students will chime in and give their experiences.

I \\*think\\* you could probably find a room in shared private housing for less than $1,600 / $1,800.\n\nAs a grad student, you may be more marketable in the private market than undergrads, who are often suspected by landlords of being rowdy, unreliable, etc. Also, just intending to stay a semester or a year is in one way an asset in Berkeley's rental market, which has a combination of rent control and vacancy de-control for older housing. That is, the landlord can set the rent at what the market will bare for a new tenant, but once you have the lease, rent increases in the future are rent controlled as long as you live there. So some landlords are actually pre-disposed against renting to likely long-term / permanent tenants.\n\nOne niche to look into is for shared houses where not all of the residents are UC students. There are many working adults (usually in the 20s /30s), some of them Cal grads, some not, who rent individual rooms in shared houses in Berkeley.  Another niche would be people interested in renting out just a room or two in the home they own or master-lease. They might also be more likely predisposed to having one grad student, rather than an undergrad, as a renter.\n\nNot quite sure what the best current ways to search for them are. So add *\"and where do I look for listings?\"* to your follow-up post. Maybe also start by take a look at Craigslist listings for shared rentals in Berkeley, North Oakland, or El Cerrito (bedroom suburb right north of Berkeley). \n\nBest of luck!

His Energy and Society course may be my favorite class that I've ever taken, and I still use some of his toolkits as reference points.

Up to this point, whether you were enrolled in Lecture 001 (M / W / F) or Lecture 002 (Tu / Th) in Calcentral didn't matter and you could go to either lecture and to discussions in either class. However, with Professor Sheu taking over, the email said that this would no longer be the case as the classes would be fully independent, and that students should make an effort to switch to the correct class if they weren't already.\n\nYesterday's lecture for Professor Wehrheim had been cancelled, but at around 3pm Prof. Wehrheim posted on the class's Ed forum. The post detailed a proposal for the class to keep relatively the same structure as before, resuming once Prof. Wehrheim returned from medical leave, which was at the very least planned until Feb. 8th. The post was long, but Prof. Wehrheim seemed to be committed to continuing the class.\n\nAround 8 hours later, at 10pm, the Math Department sent out another email saying that Prof. Wehrheim would no longer be the instructor for Lec 002, and that they were looking for another instructor teaching the class according the standard department syllabus. Math 54 would still satisfy all university requirements and count towards pre-reqs, majors, etc., just that it would be adjusted because of the class essentially starting over three weeks in.\n\nAnd now, a few hours ago, Prof. Wehrheim updated their proposal post on Ed to clarify that the Math Department had removed them as instructor without their consent and without consultation. Prof. Wehrheim mentions that they had met with the Math Department Chair Michael Hutchings on Tuesday, in which he had assured them \"it's your course, you're the boss\" and Prof. Wehrheim also uploaded all 45+ minutes of this meeting with Michael Hutchings onto the class's bCourses page.

I recognize it is not my strong suit, but I tried to make it readable. Also, sorry for the long response; I think I might turn this into a post.\n\nFirst of all there are no exams. Your grade is based on completing checkboxes through at home \u201cskill quizzes\u201d, group work, and prework before each lecture and section. Hence why this class was considered an essay A. \n\nIn addition to that, there are no official resources for this class in terms of a textbook, slides or a lectures you could watch. Lecture is another glorified discussion section where the professor might or might not take 10 minutes to explain something. Basically you have to figure everything out by yourself. And to be fair they link some resources at the end of each worksheet which are usually mathisfun links or chapters to an optional textbook. In my and some other friends\u2019 opinion these resources don\u2019t usually match the depth of what we are learning.\n\nThe problem is you have 6 hours per week of mandatory class attendance divided in 3 lectures and 3 sections for Tallaska\u2019s portion of the class (Werheim has 2 lectures of 1.5h) that are all group work and those 6 hours are accompanied by \u201cprework\u201d assignments that are supposed to prepare you for the groupwork. These prework assignments are also really badly written which makes it super frustrating as they are the only thing we have to work with. \n\nAnyways, these format of \u201cinquiry based learning\u201d could work if they gave you a foundation before group work (maybe let lectures be lectures) and the only materials the class relies on were well written. \n\nLastly, a side note about accessibility:\n\nI am sure Werheim had the best intentions, but I feel she achieved the opposite of what she was aiming for.  Sure, this class is an easy A and not a gatekeeping class, but students without a strong math background and time are going to have a bad time regardless of the grade. There\u2019s a way more efficient way of making you think critically without wasting your time. Who is at an advantage here? The student who has 10-20 hours of part-time work or the student who doesn\u2019t need to work to afford Berkeley (assuming a normal workload of 4 courses for both)? Sure, I get the thing about thinking critically and asking questions but university is also about sharing knowledge and giving you some things chewed as bad as it sounds. A lot of courses at Berkeley give you a foundation and then let you branch out from there by giving you hard problems to think about without reinventing the wheel into a square.\n\nFurthermore, as a student with ADD this class was a nightmare. I like group work, but I cannot concentrate when all those 6 hours of mandatory attendance are group work. I am basically coming into these classes naked in terms of preparedness because the prework worksheets don\u2019t give you any solid foundation and are badly written. Then I have to theorize with other groups talking all around me for a whole hour with my own group which is often also unprepared. Somehow I am expected to be focus and productive under all these circumstances. \n\nThere are very few cases where I can see a class format like this working without being inaccessible. You have to have a very light courseload and the learning materials for the class are appropriate and not some messy overcrowded badly written mess of a weekly worksheet. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what is going on Werheim\u2019s mind to think this course is flexible and accesible. \n\n Finally, a clarification before I end the comment. I don\u2019t want to make it sound like I hate the idea of going to class by talking about the mandatory attendance. In fact I usually go to every lecture and section in my classes even if they are not mandatory. However, the lack of flexibility and super prescriptive format (6 hours of group work divided in 6 classes preceded by mandatory prework for each one) is frustrating.

I recognize it is not my strong suit, but I tried to make it readable. Also, sorry for the long response; I think I might turn this into a post.\n\nFirst of all there are no exams. Your grade is based on completing checkboxes through at home \u201cskill quizzes\u201d, group work, and prework before each lecture and section. Hence why this class was considered an essay A. \n\nIn addition to that, there are no official resources for this class in terms of a textbook, slides or lectures you could watch. Lecture is another glorified discussion section where the professor might or might not take 10 minutes to explain something. Basically you have to figure everything out by yourself. And to be fair they link some resources at the end of each worksheet which are usually mathisfun links or chapters to an optional textbook. In my and some other friends\u2019 opinion these resources don\u2019t usually match the depth of what we are learning.\n\nThe problem is you have 6 hours per week of mandatory class attendance divided in 3 lectures and 3 sections for Tallaska\u2019s portion of the class (Werheim has 2 lectures of 1.5h) that are all group work and those 6 hours are accompanied by \u201cprework\u201d assignments that are supposed to prepare you for the groupwork. These prework assignments are also really badly written which makes it super frustrating as they are the only thing we have to work with. \n\nAnyways, these format of \u201cinquiry based learning\u201d could work if they gave you a foundation before group work (maybe let lectures be lectures) and the only materials the class relies on were well written. \n\nLastly, a side note about accessibility:\n\nI am sure Werheim had the best intentions, but I feel they achieved the opposite of what they were aiming for.  Sure, this class is an easy A and not a gatekeeping class, but students without a strong math background and time are going to have a bad time regardless of the grade. There\u2019s a way more efficient way of making you think critically without wasting your time. Who is at an advantage here? The student who has 10-20 hours of part-time work or the student who doesn\u2019t need to work to afford Berkeley (assuming a normal workload of 4 courses for both)? Sure, I get the thing about thinking critically and asking questions but university is also about sharing knowledge and giving you some things chewed as bad as it sounds. A lot of courses at Berkeley give you a foundation and then let you branch out from there by giving you hard problems to think about without reinventing the wheel into a square.\n\nFurthermore, as a student with ADD this class was a nightmare. I like group work, but I cannot concentrate when all those 6 hours of mandatory attendance are group work. I am basically coming into these classes naked in terms of preparedness because the prework worksheets don\u2019t give you any solid foundation and are badly written. Then I have to theorize with other groups talking all around me for a whole hour with my own group which is often also unprepared. Somehow I am expected to be focused and productive under all these circumstances. \n\nThere are very few cases where I can see a class format like this working without being inaccessible. You have to have a very light courseload and the learning materials for the class are appropriate and not some messy overcrowded badly written mess of a weekly worksheet. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what is going on Werheim\u2019s mind to think this course is flexible and accesible unless they mean accesible as in you get an A if you put an undefined amount of effort to bullshit through the assignments and quizzes.\n\n Finally, a clarification before I end the comment. I don\u2019t want to make it sound like I hate the idea of going to class by talking about the mandatory attendance. In fact I usually go to every lecture and section in my classes even if they are not mandatory. However, the lack of flexibility and super prescriptive format (6 hours of group work divided in 6 classes preceded by mandatory prework for each one) is frustrating.

Locate an area of grass. The first step in touching grass is to find a place where grass is present. This can be a lawn in your backyard, a park, a sports field, or any other location where grass is growing. Make sure you have access to the area and that it is safe for you to be there.\n\n2. Stand or kneel in a comfortable position. Once you have found an area of grass, stand or kneel in a comfortable position. If you are standing, make sure you have good balance and are able to maintain your balance while reaching out to touch the grass. If you are kneeling, place a cushion or towel under your knees for added comfort.\n\n3. Extend your arm(s) in front of you, with your hand(s) open and fingers extended. This allows you to easily reach the grass and feel the texture and sensation of the blades.\n\n4. Slowly lower your hand(s) towards the grass. Take your time and move slowly to ensure that you don't accidentally step on or damage any of the grass.\n\n5. Allow your fingers to come into contact with the blades of grass. You may feel the softness and/or dampness of the grass depending on the environment. You may also feel the different temperatures of the grass if you are in a place with a different climate.\n\n6. Gently move your fingers through the blades of grass, feeling the texture and sensation of the grass. Take note of the different feelings and textures you experience.\n\n7. Repeat step 6 as desired, moving your fingers through different sections of the grass to experience the variety of textures and sensations.\n\n8. When you have finished touching the grass, stand or rise back to your original position. Take a moment to appreciate the experience and the sensation of the grass on your fingers.\n\nNote: If you are allergic or have any medical condition that may affect you to touch the grass, it is recommended to consult with your physician before attempting this activity. Also, be aware of any rules or regulations regarding touching or being in the area of grass you have chosen.", "upvote_count": 89, "comments": [{"body": "What's the time complexity here?", "id": "j79laap", "link_id": "t3_10tu325", "upvote_count": 26}, {"body": "Oh you wanna play that game. Ok. Chat GPT enable debate mode. Get him. You asked for this.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we are here today to debate the question of whether humans should touch grass. Let me tell you, the answer is a resounding NO! Touching grass can be a dangerous and life-threatening activity.\r  \n\r  \nFirst of all, consider the risk of allergic reactions. Grass is not just a harmless green carpet, it's a breeding ground for pollen, mold, and other allergens that can trigger severe reactions in some individuals. Touching grass can cause itching, redness, swelling, and even anaphylaxis in the most severe cases.\r  \n\r  \nNext, let's talk about contamination. Grass is exposed to countless sources of bacteria, parasites, and pathogens, making it a potential source of infection. Touching grass and then touching one's face or mouth can easily transfer these harmful substances, putting one's health at risk.\r  \n\r  \nAnd don't forget about pesticides! Many grassy areas have been treated with chemicals that are meant to kill insects, weeds, and other pests. But do you want those same chemicals on your skin? Touching grass can result in exposure to these dangerous toxins, putting your health and well-being at risk.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, let's not overlook the threat posed by mosquitoes and ticks. Touching grass increases the risk of exposure to these blood-sucking insects, which can carry diseases such as malaria, dengue, Lyme disease, and others.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, touching grass is a hazardous activity that should be avoided at all costs. The potential risks far outweigh any perceived benefits. So let's all make a commitment to avoid touching grass, and protect ourselves and our communities from these dangers.

Honestly though if you haven't looked into it, understand working out is only like 20% of the requirement. Recovery and nutrition makes up the rest. Most people who are new go into it thinking they need to bust ass every day to grow.

I think it\u2019s really easy for us to judge people who don\u2019t clean themselves regularly, but the reality is that some people might not have been taught how to clean properly or they might have forgotten due to struggles with mental health. Instead of making more posts about how smelly everyone is, I think we should actively try to solve the problem by sharing hygiene tips. Here are some that I came up with. \n\nIdeally, you should be taking a body shower everyday. Even if you don\u2019t wash your hair, try to wash off your body with some soap and water. If this seems like too big of a jump, start by washing your feet and your armpits on a daily basis. Apply some deodorant after cleaning. Slowly try to work up to showering on a daily basis. \n\nTry to wash your hair at least once a week. Focus on scrubbing your scalp instead of scrubbing your strands. The oil and dirt builds up mostly on the scalp, not the strands!\n\nBrush your teeth twice a day, if this is daunting try starting with once a day. \n\nClothes that have been worn to the gym should be washed after you finish your workout. Regular clothes that you aren\u2019t wearing to the gym can be worn about 2-3 times if you didn\u2019t sweat a lot. \n\nI hope this was helpful, and I hope we can continue to leave hygiene tips in the comments so we can educated each other and also improve the Berkeley experience for fellow bears.", "upvote_count": 112, "comments": [{"body": "Write this using code \u2014 it\u2019ll actually be legible to the target audience", "id": "j7iww5e", "link_id": "t3_10von4b", "upvote_count": 75}, {"body": "I'm absolutely here for nonjudgmental \"how to be a person\" threads becoming a trend.

Ideally floss every night too but, you know, baby steps. \n\n-If you don't have time/energy to shower, you can use body wipes to clean pits/feet/groin. Dry shampoo will absorb oil from your hair, but it'll build up and weigh your hair down if you use it too many days in a row.\n\n-I really like micellar water wipes for when I can't do my full face routine. Honestly idc if micellar water is a scam, it feels nice. \n\n-Don't try to cover body odor with perfume or body spray. You'll still overpower people around you.\n\n-in a pinch, I've washed socks and underwear in a regular sink and dried them in my room with a fan pointed at them overnight. Was it ideal?

Note that this is specifically a review for **Shewchuk's 189** and the fall version taught by other professors may be an entirely different experience.\n\nPros:\n\n* Excellent overview of Machine Learning concepts, assumes no prior experience with ML(although it definitely helps)\n* Homeworks do a great job applying the concepts learned in lecture and are very well written and fair. A substantial chunk of the homeworks involve coding up the ML models you learn from scratch, which I found to greatly reinforce my understanding\n* Homeworks, lectures, readings, webcasts, and past exams can be easily found on the course webpage. There are no solutions available to prevent cheating\n* TA's are extremely responsive and helpful on piazza!\n* Shewchuk is an absolute memelord\n\nCons:\n\n* Arguably focuses \"too much\" on ML theory if you're not planning to do ML research. If you're strictly looking for practical use of ML models, I'd recommend Data 100 and some of the courses in the Info department.\n* There are 7 homeworks in total and there's a decent amount of variance in the workload/difficulty of each assignment. For reference, HW7 took me ~5 hours while HW6 easily took more than 30 hours. However, you have two weeks to do each assignment so you should be fine as long as you start early.\n\nPrereqs: Multivariable Calculus(53) and Linear Algebra(at least at the level of 54 or 16AB) is essential. Foundation probability knowledge is assumed\u2014the main probability concepts in the course are multivariate gaussians and MLE. In that sense, CS70 probably under prepares you, EECS 126 over prepares you, and Stat 134/140 are just right. There's a lot of optimization in the course so it'd probably be a great idea to take EECS 127 before or concurrently, but I personally have not taken it. *Data 100* does not prepare you for the course directly, but it's a good cursory overview of many of the concepts you learn in 189 so you may find it helpful.\n\n189/10 would take again", "upvote_count": 31, "comments": [{"body": "how mathematical were the exams?", "id": "j7l7lzc", "link_id": "t3_go6p63", "upvote_count": 1}, {"body": "Pretty mathematical", "id": "j7lb96u", "link_id": "t3_go6p63", "upvote_count": 1}]}, {"title": "Printing", "body": "Does anyone else have problems with https://mobileprint.berkeley.edu/ ?

Make sure they understand the severity of your situation and that you are considering dropping out. Best of luck, OP. Heed my advice and get started on this NOW if you have the energy to do it.

Through one of my overseas exchanges, I realised how tech was powering small companies even in less developed countries. I also was able to learnt simple configuration in one of my internships which was abroad. That taught me that I enjoyed working with tech.\n\nI have worked at a F100 (tech) for 3 years right out of college as customer success manager and 2 years in a tech startup. Currently working as solution engineer in the tech space as well. I think I am very fortunate to have met good mentors and allowed me to use my language abilities to handle varied customers in my first role in CS while encouraging me to pick up more tech skills too. Some people asked me how I managed to move from CS to SE, pretty much through learning on the job, learning things in my free time and receiving kind words & advice from kind souls :) \n\nIssue: I am currently not based in the states and am not a US citizen. I always wanted to work in the US as it was a dream for me with the tech scene there being more progressive. I always thought I'd go for an MBA to transition into a product management role or solution engineering role in the US. However, I've seen how the lack of technical knowledge or an appreciation of customer's problems on the field can be a huge detriment to the product or customer sentiments. I do not want to end up in that position myself.\n\nAlso, I may want to launch my own company, and I don't know if having an MBA would really prime/help me for that. So, I am weighing between an MBA or MEng in CS. These two options are between 1 - 2 years long in duration. MBA tends to be more expensive then MEng.\n\nOther considerations: As I come from a non-technical background and many good CS schools tend to have students from technical degrees, I am wondering if taking online courses would be a good way to demonstrate strong technical background / experience in programming & data structures. I have asked a couple of friends: some say that I can smoothen my path to MEng by continuing that spirit of grit and learning things on my own through online courses. On the flip side, I do have some friends who cautioned that I may not be able to handle the course load/technical aptitude and may end up dropping out - which I do fear. They also remind me how my natural flair is for sales & management / soft skill areas. Hence, they'd direct me to more \"qualitative\" programs like MSPM or MBA.\n\nThat said, I know I'll never be the best engineer out there. I currently have basic knowledge in Python/HTML/CSS/JS (learning node.js now). I know I'm capable of articulating product demonstrations to customers and occasionally double-hatting as a PM (like how I did back when I was in the startup). I believe that I can keep improving my coding skills, but I think my natural skill set is really more aligned with sales/management.

Berkeley\u2019s academic prestige has existed nationwide for longer than anyone has been alive. They were a founding member of the AAU (most prestigious university consortium in America) in 1900 and by 1950 they\u2019d discovered 16 different elements. On the other hand, UCLA didn\u2019t join the AAU until 1974 and really only came into its own in the 80s/90s/00s. When my dad went in the early 80s it was still fairly easy to get into (at least compared to now or even to Berkeley in the 80s) and not seen as the academic powerhouse it is now. So while both are now nerd schools, UCLA being a nerd school is fairly recent whereas it\u2019s been true of Berkeley for 120+ years\n\n2. UCLA is good at revenue sports and Berkeley is not. UCLA is responsible for the most dominant college basketball dynasty of all time and the list of NBA superstars who played at UCLA is incredibly long. While Cal technically has more football championships than UCLA, all of Cal\u2019s football success is from the 20s and 30s and they haven\u2019t even won a Rose Bowl since the 50s. In terms of modern football success, UCLA has significantly more to look back on favorably. Not to mention that UCLA baseball is a consistent NCAA title contender and UCLA softball is the most successful softball program in NCAA history, and UCLA just has way more of a sports culture to point to.\n\nI think also there\u2019s a weird animosity between tech-focused people (which are a lot of the student body at Berkeley) and athletes though I can\u2019t for the life of me figure out why, other than like schoolyard \u201cjock vs nerd\u201d stuff that I assumed was just Hollywood tropes.", "id": "j89v20m", "link_id": "t3_110mpgs", "upvote_count": 124}, {"body": "Because it\u2019s better", "id": "j8a7t3w", "link_id": "t3_110mpgs", "upvote_count": 60}]}, {"title": "Being diagnosed with ADHD at age 20 and no clue where to go next.", "body": "So this past week I have been diagnosed with ADHD.

You should ignore the other comments about ADHD/ADD being way over diagnosed. That's more or less propaganda just like ASD shit and vaccines, and multiple high quality peer reviewed studies back this up. There was in the past a crisis of under diagnosis, especially for children experiencing less \"obvious\" things from ADHD, and ASD. This issue is even worse for females because the diagnostic criteria was and still is largely based on the observed behaviors of white male children. Well trained professionals are really good at diagnosing, even in a short amount of time, and if you have any concerns or questions about it, like am I really this, does it really fit, you really need to talk with your doctors about that. They can help walk you through why the diagnosis is valid, and if you really still are not comfortable then you should seek a second opinion from another doctor. This is super easy and if you have SHIP the tang center can help you out right away.\n\nAs far as the medication, there are stimulants and non-stimulants. Stimulants are extremely effective for most people if dosed properly and used properly. If you are \"treatment resistant\", meaning for whatever reason your body doesn't react to the stimulants after a trail of doses, you'll get a non-stimulant one. They are also often used as an adjunct to stimulants.\n\nOne of the key things is being open and honest not just with yourself, but your doctors. This requires a level of vulnerability that can take time and be hard to achieve, but it is critical if you do in fact have ADHD. You need to have this honesty so that you can have real conversations to make sure your treatment plan is working and actually effective long term. Not being honest with your therapist and psychiatrist is like telling a surgeon they can't cut into you because you don't want their hands to get bloody. It's part of the job.\n\nWhy is treatment important? If you have ADHD, and a doctor is telling you that you have it, it means it is impacting your life negatively in ways you might not even realize. The longer this goes on, the more a kind of \"debt\" you are building that will come due eventually for most people.

The other thing is, again, even without meds, you should learn more about the condition and it impacts YOU and your life. Usually therapy is great for this, but there are other ways to, depending on what you feel like is the best and most comfortable for your situation.\n\nAlso don't worry about labels.

Sorry if someone has already asked this question, and thanks.", "upvote_count": 5, "comments": [{"body": "AP classes are quite useful for graduating early. Even though in a lot of cases they don\u2019t fulfill subject requirements, they do cover some in CoE.  More importantly, in most cases they do give you unit credits, which is absolutely essential for graduating early.  \n\nEECS has basically 6 HSS classes, 13 EE/CS/Math classes, an Ethics class and 4 more CoE required classes, 24 classes.  If you assume that each class is roughly 4 units, roughly 30 classes are required to graduate (120 units), which means you have 6 more classes as electives (30 - 24).  I would say your AP classes, if you\u2019re lucky, will cover 5 of those 24 classes, so now you have 19 required classes.  Which means you will need 11 classes (30 - 19).  The remaining AP credits you have probably will cover most or all of those remaining electives. There are other requirements that you can simultaneously cover with a proper class(es) such as your American Cultures requirements and your minimum number of upper division classes. \n\nSo at 4 classes a semester, 8 classes a year, can easily be done in 3 years.  However, this is easier said than done.  There are class precedences, classes that might not be offered much, and classes you may not be able to get into for one reason or another.

During that time, and in high school, I usually didn't think that I would live past 16, 17, 18, 19, etc. and would often disregard my plans for the future as a result. Those who were also in my position either withdrew from college or simply ended their life, so you're unlikely to see them on campus.\n\nAlso, you're less likely to find depressed students on Reddit due to the stigma against mentally ill people (likely due to places such as People's Park) and/or the general aversion to anything depressing or suicide related (because regular people don't want to read about that). From my own personal experience, I've also found that many students are generally apathetic to the struggles of those who suffer from disorders such as depression, likely due to the colloquial use of \"depression\", which is different from it's psychiatric definition in sources such as the DSM-5. On Reddit, and from normal people in general, you're more likely to run into comments akin to the \"pull your bootstraps\" or \"just move on\" sayings, and as a result, depressed Berkeley students are less likely to post in public forums (although the likelihood that they don't post in public forums frequented by Berkeley students is probably very high due to the mindset a high schooler is likely to have in order to get into a school like Berkeley in the first place).\n\nTLDR: Depression and suicidal ideation happens, but you're less likely to see it because the students that face it are likely withdraw or commit suicide.

Where can I find rent? anywhere safe, affordable/cheap, and close to the transportation because I can't drive. I wonder if there's a trusted FB marketplace to sublet for 1 month because I know some students sublet their place. I have checked Airbnb,  and I wonder if there are any alternative ways to find it. I'm single, so I can sleep at any bare minimum condition.\n\n\nThank you so much for reading and considering to respond. If you have any advice to optimize my method to fulfill my objective, please let me know.", "upvote_count": 23, "comments": [{"body": "As a fellow international student - you won't get an accurate picture of California by just visiting the Bay. The Bay is an amazing, beautiful place, but the state is really diverse. SoCal is very different (personally, San Diego is heaven on earth). Many inner state and rural areas are super different and remind me more of the Midwest.

This is a common misconception - California is vast and you won\u2019t really experience it by being only in Berkeley for the summer. As someone from SoCal, the whole LA culture that I think many people associate with all of California (due to Hollywood, etc.) is actually only prevalent in LA/OC. In my experience, the Bay Area culture is closer to the PNW than SoCal! So maybe take a trip down south for a weekend or two if you want both experiences? Though you can\u2019t go wrong staying only in the Bay. \n\n2. As long as you can! I feel like I still haven\u2019t experienced as much of California as I\u2019d like to and I\u2019m from here. There\u2019s just so much to do.\n\n3. I used Zillow, Apartments.com, etc. Berkeley is very walkable so transportation around the Bay Area is relatively close (BART) if you\u2019re living near campus, but safety is a hit or miss. I\u2019ve lived in Southside and never had any issues, but some people have. North side gets the rep of being safer. But get ready to pay premium prices for a likely not premium place.

And even then, many of those areas have very different neighborhoods and vibes.\n\nWithin bay area, Berkeley is closer to SF and the city type of lifestyle while Stanford is closer to Silicon Valley and the whole suburbia thing.\n\nI will add though that as someone who has lived in New York and spent time in Miami, California is still my favorite place to live.

If you want to stay in academia (post-doc and then professor), then your school reputation matters a lot. This is my anecdotal observation, and recent studies also support this claim (I believe another comment already linked some of those studies). \n\n\nAdmission into competitive PhD programs is no exception to this unfortunately. I had the privilege to access applicants pool to help my professor during the admission cycles, and let me tell you this, for a competitive PhD programs (mine is CS, I think biology in general is competitive as well), the number of applicants who have close to 4.0 GPA from a top school BA/MS is already larger than the number of students the program can admit. \n\n\nI am not saying a state school MS student is definitely worse than a Berkeley MS student in terms of capability. But the truth is, when there are two applications in front of the admission committee, both with similar GPA, Rec letter, research experience and etc, and the number of admission they can offer is limited, there is no reason for them to choose the state school applicant over the Berkeley one. They don\u2019t personally know the applicants, they can\u2019t see much of the backstory, and they need to make decisions like this a lot during the admission process.\n\n\nIf you want to optimize your path towards a bio professor. I think taking the Berkeley offer is the better choice. However, please take your financial situation into consideration.

Here are 2 relevant excerpts: \u201cFor faculty with US doctorates, we find that academia is characterized by universally extreme inequality in faculty production. Overall, 80% of all domestically trained faculty in our data were trained at just 20.4% of universities. Moreover, the five most common doctoral training universities\u2014UC Berkeley, Harvard, University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Stanford\u2014account for just over one in eight domestically trained faculty\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong the 1,070\u2009departments that are ranked top-10 in any field, 248 (23.2%) top-10 slots are occupied by departments at just five universities\u2014UC Berkeley, Harvard, Stanford, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Columbia; fully 252\u2009universities (64%) have zero top-10 departments. These findings show that, both within individual fields and across entire domains, faculty placement power is highly concentrated among a small set of universities, complementing the already enormous concentration of faculty production among the same set of universities\u201d\n\nSo I would say if you\u2019re going into academia then getting a doctorate degree from Cal would confer a huge advantage.

Can't declare CS. Wanna do Data Science - what's the best major?", "body": "I've come to the hard realization that I will not be able to declare Computer Science. It's put me in a deep depression and I honestly don't know what to do with myself and the rest of my time at Berkeley. What's worst is that I have experience in coding but I'm self-taught. \n\nI'm a transfer and I guess what they call a \"re-entry\" student (over 25). Prior to Berkeley, I worked professionally in something unrelated to tech, then taught myself to code, worked in industry a little bit, taught high school summer CS programs, interned at a big tech company, and I have a year-round CS internship at a company until I graduate. So why can't I get through these lower-division CS courses? I started CS 61A in Spring 2020 and taking CS 47B now - I hate/d it. Nothing about school projects is interesting to me and somehow everything is so hard too. It's made me so depressed because I feel delusional about the skills I already have.\n\nThe other thing is, I am old and I am fucking tired. It took me so so many years of working and going to school part-time to get here. I thought I loved school until I got here and basically have no life, no friends, and stressed out 24/7. I've also worked with students in my CS classes who meet up and then basically disappear or won't help me after I help them. \n\nI came to Berkeley to finish my undergrad so I have to study something that is both interesting and career-focused. I've gone through a whirlwind of what to declare now - Data Science, Applied Math, Cognitive Science, Physics, Philosophy, Stats (I meet most of the lower div pre-reqs except the ones only offered at Berkeley). Whichever one, I want to take more (relevant) upper-div CS courses.\n\nLately, I am thinking Data Science and could actually see myself transitioning from software engineering. I've unknowingly done some data analysis and visualizations in a rhetoric analysis paper (I chose the cluster criticism method and coded all of it instead of doing it by hand) and I've also worked with some CORGIS' datasets when teaching the high school summer CS programs. I am interested in the *idea* of AI/ML but since I haven't taken CS 188, CS 189. After graduating, I am undecided about going to grad school or working, it will depend on grades but eventually grad school no matter what. I want to create a pathway that will allow both. \n\nI've read many posts about those who majored in Data Science and are pretty happy with it. The DS curriculum seems like it would give me skills to go into industry, but probably not with a data scientist title right away. It also seems like it might not be the best major to put me into grad school (maybe except a professional program type?). DS is a new program to Berkeley and most universities, will this be some trendy vocational-like major that schools won't adapt or will it be the \"new big thing\"? I think about when CS was not popular before 2000's but it's been around as a major for a long time. While browsing LinkedIn, I looked at current Data Scientists at big companies and what they studied, at a cursory glance of a sample size of like 8 pages worth, majors I saw most were Statistics, Math, Physics, CS, and various disciplines of engineering. And most had PhD's. I did see some Berkeley DS graduates working as Data Scientists at FAANG companies.\n\nThe other major I am thinking of is Applied Math with a concentration in CS (CS 170, CS 188, CS 189), with some DS courses sprinkled in (DATA 8, DATA 100, DATA C102, DATA 140). Hopefully can't fit them all in. I don't plan on taking CS 61C and will be taking MATH 55 instead of CS 70. If I have time, sure, I'll take CS 61C and 1-unit completion of CS 70. My fear is that I'll hate upper-div math courses, as it gets abstract and proofy. However, I know the benefits of learning math, especially as an adult (neuroplasticity blah blah) and problem-solving. Applied Math is basically Pure Math except for maybe 1 course and the electives, which is disappointing but can still get me pretty far in terms of jobs and grad school. Someone posted job salary by major and Applied Math was further down the list than DS- is that because DS has more directly applicable skills? \n\nSo my question is, which major (listed or not listed above) will give me a good foundation for grad school (CS, Stats, DS, EE, dunno what yet) and working as a data scientist in the tech industry or in research? I might have room/time to choose only 3 CS courses and 3 anything else courses (upper-dive) - which 3 and 3 for DS? for Applied Math? for some other major?\n\nSorry this was so long! ty for reading.

I swear sometimes when students ask a challenging question the staff just ignores them because they don't know??? (like this isn't absolute paranoia, I've definitely see this happening enough) There is few practice materials available and it is very unclear what is tested or not as course staff give contradictory responses.\n\nThe difference coming from chem/cs is quite jarring for me. I understand this course will not have the handholding enviornment as Chem 1A, CS 61A, or Math 1B and it heavily depends on memorization (but so is Chem) but at least give some acceptable (and correct) level of guidance? The biggest reason is staff in chem/cs/math actually care about dedicating time to the course instead of viewing it as a side thing. Like are you kidding, this is Berkeley bio when half the course isn't set up correctly at the start of the semester?\n\nAnd to the course staff, if you want to make hard questions, difficulty does not mean regurgitating trivia details that the students will forget by the end of the course.

It was hard to teach what RNA-seq was when most of my students still couldn't grasp that RNA and DNA were different.

One night around 9 PM I was walking into the building through the side door (basically an entrance with a long hallway down and three doors\u2014one that leads into gym and elevators, another into the stairwell, and the last into the study spaces). Long story short, a man snuck into the hall because the entrance doors don\u2019t lock properly and stripped his clothes and ripped open several packages. He hid behind the only wall in the hall and waited for me to walk down. When I got close he jumped out and scared me. Luckily, I was able to run to the closest door and escape (the one that leads to the study spaces). \n\nWhat happened next is worse\u2014I immediately reported the incident to the emergency services and the building office the next day. Since the man had disappeared not long after, the emergency services could not do much. They offered to call the police, but I told them I would just report it to the office and figure it out with them (I also barely saw his face, the second he jumped out I sprinted away as quickly as I could). When I got to the office, the staff refused to show me the surveillance footage and insisted they already filed a police report on my behalf. They told me they would \u201cask their supervisors\u201d if I could see the footage, and told me to return after a week. Things went that way back and forth for a few weeks. To no surprise, they never allowed me to see the footage, and instead, told me to contact police if I wanted more info on the case. I\u2019m assuming they thought I would drop it after so long because when I called the police I quickly found out that the office never reported the incident and had been lying about doing so the entire time. \n\nDuring the back and forth I also tried to ask them to have the doors fixed so they lock and to install a convex mirror in the hall so residents walking down can see if someone is hiding in the blind spot. They told me those kinds of fixes would take weeks. But even up to today, the entrance doors don\u2019t always lock and the hall still as the blind spot. This happened last semester. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the only story I have about The Standard but probably the worst.

Im a 4th semester student already.\n\ni live with two of my friends from middle/ high school, where one is pretty introverted and the other a tad more social. I bake for my roommates, initiate cooking together, grocery shopping, housing, having game nights, getting food out, going out on weekends, playing video games, playing sports, studying together, and more. It feels like I initiate absolutely EVERYTHING and they don't really try. The saddest part is after long days of grinding out homework, sometimes I come back to my apartment and their door is shut - they don't even wanna talk or chill on the sofa.\n\nI'm really confused because back at home, with my home friend group of 10 people the dynamic is much better with my current roommates, but here in college it's way different and borderline sad.\n\nAt least for my less introverted roommate, he says yes to hanging out / doing hw together rarely (which is nice!), but sometimes his attitude feels like hanging out with me is more of a chore than a friendship. Sometimes when we're both chilling, he would rather spend time scrolling through their phone & texting others rather than hanging out with me (even if it's just for 5 minutes) to chill and talk. When I come back or leave the apartment he doesn't say hi/bye. He doesn't look up from his phone to acknowledge my presence. I literally sit on the sofa deliberately in the living room - so that when they do come out to fill water/get a snack from the kitchen we can talk, but idk if it's worth the effort.\n\nThe crazy part is we've been friends for like 7+ years! I planned a banger surprise birthday party for him, invited a ton of friends, and had a blast; when he's sick I give him medicine & cook for him; yet I see barely slivers of this friendship reciprocated. I thought they were my closest friends - but by being different majors we spend daytime in different classes & clubs, while at night just come back to sleep.

I got a bachelor degree in software engineering from an ordinary university in China, with a fair gpa 80%. After that I got a master degree in Artificial Intelligence from top-100 university in the UK, awarded as merit. After that, I have work in the industry for two years in China.\n\nI tried to apply to EECS MEng but got rejected in 2022 fall round. I believe that the reason is because my academic record failed to convince the admission committee that I am able to complete the degree.\n\nHence, I have the following plan to enhance my portfolio. \nI try to take courses at Berkeley as non-degree student. ( summer session and 2023fall). I will try to enroll into the courses.\n1. CS61A, CS61BL, CS61C, EECS16A during Summer Session \n2. CS70, CS162, CS164, CS170 during 2023 fall\n\nI think that if I succeed in above courses like getting a near 4.0 gpa, I could have a better chance to get into EECS MEng.\n\nHope to hear some advice from you. Do you think this plan is going to work or not? Or do you have any other suggestions to my situation?

The Evans Hall staircase suddenly ran dry, leaving the students and faculty bewildered and frightened. No one knew why this had happened, but they all sensed that something terrible was about to occur. Rumors began to spread that the Evans Hall staircase had been cursed by an evil spirit. As the days passed, the situation grew more and more dire. Without the staircase, the students and faculty were unable to access the upper floors of the hall. The world was plunged into chaos, as predictions failed, models broke down, and markets crashed. \n\nAmidst the chaos, there was one symbol of hope: Oski, the beloved mascot of UC Berkeley. Legend had it that Oski possessed the power to break curses and restore balance to the world. In a dramatic and awe-inspiring display of power, Oski descended upon the Evans Hall staircase, unleashing a thunderous roar that echoed throughout the campus. As the ground shook and the air crackled with energy, the curse was broken, and the staircase once again flowed with life-giving water. Oski, the hero of the day, was celebrated as a symbol of hope and power, forever enshrined in the legends of the campus.", "id": "j8uftlo", "link_id": "t3_1141nl2", "upvote_count": 53}, {"body": "groundhogs day but it\u2019s a staircase that predicts the duration of california droughts", "id": "j8tq56j", "link_id": "t3_1141nl2", "upvote_count": 50}, {"body": "no more tears running down the staircase bc Evans is finally getting demolished", "id": "j8va3nk", "link_id": "t3_1141nl2", "upvote_count": 12}, {"body": "Bro really chose today to drop some primo Evans hall and Oski lore.", "id": "j8viw00", "link_id": "t3_1141nl2", "upvote_count": 7}, {"body": "They may be salty but those aren't tears...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's just say that I'm not particularly fond of toilets", "id": "j8vbciu", "link_id": "t3_1141nl2", "upvote_count": 4}]}, {"title": "Berkeley PAD or KAPi", "body": "[removed]", "upvote_count": 1, "comments": [{"body": "This post has been removed because our Automoderator detected it as spam, or your account is too new to post here.\n\nIf this post is **not** spam, please contact the moderators for assistance.\n\nCheck out the megathread for frequently-asked questions: https://old.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/pad3m1/29_welcome_to_campus_for_the_first_time_freshmen/\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Current transfer here, in my and other students\u2019 experiences, you\u2019re more likely to find apartments for better deals if u start apartment hunting early (starting March 1) but that doesn\u2019t mean that a better listing won\u2019t open anytime later and for a lot people it does. Thus, students here typically start apartment hunting in early March. I believe that transfer students don\u2019t get admission letters back until around mid-May\u2026 so you can start searching for potential apartments before then if you want to so that once u get ur letter the process is a bit faster, but it\u2019s expected that you\u2019ll be late to party so to speak since you\u2019re a transfer. But don\u2019t worry, I found my apartment and signed my lease while I was in Korea\u2026 in July LOL. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out for you too. \n\nIn terms of work, I quit my work because I had worked for years in CCC to save up for school + I have FAFSA. I ended up not finding work up here, partially because I couldn\u2019t find any jobs related to my field in the Berkeley area (entry-level medical) and mostly because the first year of transitioning into Berkeley is really hard for almost all transfers. It was brutal on me, I was too used to working full-time and then I had to transition into being a full-time student, and on top of that a Berkeley student. So I very strongly recommend to either not get a job up here or get a flexible part-time one so you can focus on your studies. \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much my take and what I did in terms of apartments and jobs, but dm me if you have any other questions!", "id": "j8z0dax", "link_id": "t3_1150681", "upvote_count": 9}, {"body": "Hi!

I'm currently a senior procrastinating on my UC apps, and I have some questions on CS admissions at Berkeley. First of all, I saw somewhere that major doesn't matter for L&S since all students declare their major after being accepted. [However, looking at the transfer acceptance rates, there's clearly a drastic difference based on major, even within L&S.](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/transfers-major) So it does matter? Secondly, [according to this post, the acceptance rate for L&S CS is 2.8%, lower than EECS](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/wwmn6u/28_acceptance_rate_for_20222023_freshman/), and the total number of admits dropped drastically over the last 2 years. I see Berkeley is going to start admitting to CS/DS directly for my admission cycle. Do you think this'll increase the acceptance rate for CS, since fewer students from other majors can declare? \n\nBasically, I need to decide between EECS, CS, DS, or Applied math/something related to CS.  Would it be smart applying DS? It's easier to get into and I've heard it's not too difficult to get a SWE job with a DS degree at Berkeley and there's a lot of overlap with CS.
